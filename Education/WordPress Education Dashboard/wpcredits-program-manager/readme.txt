Runs the WPCredits program on WordPress in five modules - Students, Mentors, Institutions, Sponsors and Administrators - plus a Tools section, with role-based access and Airtable sync.

== Description ==

The plugin is organized as five modules, one per audience:

1. **Students** - the Student role, Airtable account provisioning, and a private page with each student's program details and their assigned mentor. **Built.**
2. **Mentors** - the Mentor role, Airtable account provisioning, and a private page listing each mentor's assigned students. **Built.**
3. **Institutions** - the Institution role.
4. **Sponsors** - the Sponsor role, the Airtable sync of the Sponsors table, one-at-a-time account creation, the Sponsor Dashboard, the public sponsor application form, the sponsors' guide, and the sponsor queues on the Administrator Dashboard.
5. **Administrators** - the built-in WordPress Administrator role, granted the program capabilities.

Students, Mentors, Institutions and Sponsors each get a custom role cloned from **Subscriber**, plus one marker capability that controls which content they can read. Administrators can read every level.

The Students and Mentors modules are built. Institutions and Sponsors register their roles and reserve their admin screens; Administrators uses the built-in role.

Alongside them is a **Tools** section, for jobs you run *against* the program data rather than parts of the program itself. Keeping the two apart means the modules stay a stable description of the program while tools come and go as needed. It currently holds two tools: **Header notices** and **Mentor Status Checker**.

= Roles and capabilities =

| Module | Role slug | Marker capability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Students | `wpcpm_student` | `wpcpm_view_student_content` |
| Mentors | `wpcpm_mentor` | `wpcpm_view_mentor_content` |
| Institutions | `wpcpm_institution` | `wpcpm_view_institution_content` |
| Sponsors | `wpcpm_sponsor` | `wpcpm_view_sponsor_content` |
| Administrators | `administrator` | `wpcpm_manage_program` + every marker capability above |

Role slugs are prefixed on purpose. Bare `student` and `teacher` slugs are commonly claimed by LMS plugins, and sharing a role slug means sharing its capability set.

= Tools: Header notices =

One notice per audience - Students, Mentors, Institutions, Sponsors, Administrators. **WPCredits Program → Modules → Header notices** puts them all on one screen, each with its own editor, whether it is showing, and a single Save button under the lot.

**Each notice is a classic `wp_editor()` box, stored as HTML in one option.** Not `teeny`, so the media button and the kitchen-sink row are both there: a notice is written in the same place it is read about, and saving all of them is one press rather than five round trips through a post editor.

Notices were posts on the block editor until 1.22.0. The upgrade migrates each body through `do_blocks()` into the option once - that is the last moment anything knows it was block markup - and leaves the old posts alone; `uninstall.php` removes them with everything else. Nobody's words are deleted as a side effect of an upgrade.

Rendered `wpautop()` → `wp_kses_post()`. Images are capped in height on the front end and buttons scaled down - a notice is read at a glance, and markup that expects a full column of page will not get one.

Empty a notice to stop it showing; there is no separate switch.

An empty notice is off. There is no separate switch, because a switch is one more thing to leave in the wrong position.

**Anyone in two audiences sees both notices.** An administrator who also mentors gets the mentor notice and the administrator one, mentor first - they are reading as a mentor most of the time. The alternative, showing only the "most specific" audience, would withhold a notice from exactly the people holding two roles, who are the likeliest to need it. Audience membership uses the same tests the dashboards do, so an administrator matched to an Airtable mentor record counts as a mentor even though the sync never gives them the role.

Links and simple emphasis survive; scripts and other markup are stripped **on save**, so nothing dangerous is stored rather than merely hidden at render time.

Prepended to the page's content, so a notice appears at the top of the page somebody is on rather than above the site header. A theme that wants them elsewhere can return false from `wpcpm_notices_auto_render` and call `WPCPM_Notices::render()` itself. Filter `wpcpm_current_notices` to change what a given person is shown.

= Content access levels =

Every post and page gets a **Program access** control in the editor sidebar with five options: Public, Student level, Mentor level, Institution level, and Administrators only. A post with no explicit level is public.

Gating is applied in four places: front-end listings (restricted posts are filtered out), direct URL access (logged-out visitors go to the login form, logged-in users get an explanation), the rendered content and excerpt, and the REST API.

= Mentors module =

**Account provisioning.** Every mentor in the Airtable Mentors table holding the status `Active` gets a WordPress account with the Mentor role. The username comes from their WordPress.org profile, so `https://profiles.wordpress.org/clk87/` becomes the username `clk87`. That column is free text and in practice contains full URLs, scheme-less URLs, `@handles`, bare usernames, URLs ending in `/profile/` and at least one misspelled host, so every shape is reduced to its last path segment.

Accounts are created with a random password and **no email is sent**. A first sync provisions around ninety accounts at once, so invitations are opt-in: either tick the setting, or use **Send invite** next to an individual mentor, which emails them a password-reset link.

Existing accounts are matched in order of reliability - the stored Airtable record ID, then email address, then username. An account already linked to a different mentor record is reported as a conflict and left alone. Administrators' roles are never modified, and no account is ever deleted or demoted; when a mentor stops being `Active`, the plugin removes the Mentor role and clears their student list, or leaves the role in place, depending on the setting.

**The mentor page.** Activation creates a page called *My Students* at `/mentor-dashboard/`, gated to Mentor level, containing the *My Students (Mentor)* block. There is one page, not one per mentor: it renders against the logged-in user, so every mentor sees only their own students and no mentor can reach another's list by guessing a URL. Administrators can inspect any mentor's view with the *Viewing as mentor* control. An administrator who is also an Active mentor in Airtable sees their own students by default and appears in that switcher like anyone else - the sync never gives an administrator the Mentor role, so they are recognized by their link to an Airtable mentor record instead.

The mentor's own profile photo and name head the page. Each student then gets a card showing their photo, name and status, and a **table of their details** - each field and its value, with no header row:

* Status (`In Sensei` or `In Sensei 50h`)
* Internship start and end date
* Tutor
* Educational institution
* WordPress.org
* Email address, as a `mailto:` link
* Slack, linked to the program's Slack channel
* Main contribution team
* Personal website URL

Below the table is a **Student report form** button, linking to their prefilled reporting form - the Airtable *Personal link* for `In Sensei`, or *50h personal link* for `In Sensei 50h`, where the button reads **Student report form (50h)**.

= Current and past students =

The page is split in two. **Currently mentoring** lists the students a mentor is working with now, ordered by internship end date - soonest deadline first, unknown dates last. **Past students** is a separate, collapsed section for students whose mentoring has finished, ordered most recently finished first. Their details and notes are kept for reference.

Which is which comes from the student's Airtable status, not from their end date: a student can be past their end date and still being mentored, or have graduated early. Two settings control it - *Currently mentoring* (`In Sensei`, `In Sensei 50h`) and *Past students* (`Graduate`, `Dropped out`). Empty the second box to show only current students. A status listed in both counts as current, so a configuration slip can never quietly archive somebody's live student.

Past students were previously not read from Airtable at all, so **run one sync after updating** for the Past section to appear. Until then everything shows as current, exactly as before.

= Call notes =

Each student carries a running history of notes - one per call, typically - so a mentor can see what was discussed and when. Notes are written and read on the student's own card: type into **Add a note**, press **Save note**, and it appears at the top of the list stamped with the date, time and author. The collapsed row shows a note count, so it is obvious at a glance who has been spoken to and who has not.

A mentor can delete their own notes; a program manager can delete any. Nobody can delete a colleague's record of a call. There is no editing - correct a mistake by deleting and writing again.

**Past students cannot receive new notes.** A student who has graduated is not going to be called again, so the *Add a note* form is not shown for anyone in the Past students section, and a request to add one is refused rather than merely hidden. Their existing history stays readable, and still deletable.

**Who can see them.** Only mentors that student is actually assigned to, plus administrators. The check is made against the mentor's own synced student list on every read and every write, so a mentor cannot reach notes for somebody else's student even by crafting a request.

**Where they live.** In their own private post type, not in the Airtable data or the cached student rows. That matters for two reasons: the sync rewrites the whole cached student list on every run, so a note kept there would be destroyed by the next sync; and notes are WordPress-side records, never written back to Airtable. They are removed only when the plugin is uninstalled.

= Call calendar =

Students book their own mentor calls, from hours the mentor has set. A mentor who has set no availability offers nothing - the calendar is never a guess at when somebody might be free.

**The mentor sets their hours first.** *Your availability for calls*, on the mentor dashboard, takes a weekly pattern - two ranges per day, so a morning can be split from an afternoon - plus the call length, the shortest notice they will accept, how far ahead students may book, how many calls one student may hold at once, days off, and an optional note shown above the slots. The panel says how many slots that opens right now, so a schedule can be checked before anyone books against it.

**Students pick from a month calendar.** Days with something open are marked with a count and lead to that day's times. Booking is one press, with an optional note about what they would like to discuss. Both people get an email, and both can cancel - which puts the slot straight back on the calendar.

**Timezones are the point of most of this.** The program runs across a dozen countries, so a single clock would be wrong for nearly everybody. A mentor's hours are stored in the mentor's own timezone, because that is the clock they mean when they say "mornings". Every time is then shown to whoever is reading it on *their* timezone, chosen once and remembered; a student who has never chosen is offered their device's timezone rather than having it applied silently. A mentor looking at a booking also sees what time it is for the student, so a call is not rescheduled over a misunderstanding.

Daylight saving is handled rather than hoped for. Nothing is offered inside an hour the clocks skip, and on the night an hour repeats a wall-clock time is offered once, not twice - "Sunday 03:00" is one appointment, and two identical buttons would be a coin toss.

**Two students cannot take the same slot.** Booking holds a short database-level lock and re-checks the slot inside it; the insert is then checked against the table for a clash, and the later of two bookings is undone and its owner told to pick again. A slot that is taken, blocked, in the past, or inside the mentor's notice period is never generated in the first place, so no screen has to decide what to gray out and two screens cannot disagree.

**Nothing here needs JavaScript.** Months and days are links and booking is a form post. The one script offers the browser's timezone to somebody who has not set one.

Past students cannot book, for the reason they cannot receive new notes. Program managers can book on a student's behalf, which a student locked out of their account still needs. Calls live in their own private post type, are never written back to Airtable, and canceling keeps the record rather than erasing it.

= Each student collapses =

A mentor with sixty students needs a list they can scan, so each student starts collapsed. The row always shows their photo, name, status, institution and internship end date; opening it reveals the full details table.

It is a native disclosure, so it works with JavaScript switched off, responds to the keyboard, and is announced properly by screen readers. **Expand all** and **Collapse all** buttons appear above the list when scripting is available, and printing opens everything first so a printed list is never half-empty. A mentor with exactly one student gets that student already open, since collapsing a list of one helps nobody.

Note that some browsers do not search inside collapsed sections with Ctrl+F. Use **Expand all** first if you are looking for something specific.

= The mentor's landing page =

Mentors have Subscriber-level accounts, so wp-admin shows them nothing they can use. By default the *My Students* page therefore acts as their dashboard:

* Logging in takes them straight there.
* It replaces the wp-admin Dashboard, so a bookmark or a `/wp-admin/` link lands on it too.
* A **My Students** link sits in the toolbar, so they can get back from anywhere on the site.

Three deliberate exceptions. A mentor who followed a link to a specific page and was sent through the login form still ends up at **that** page, not the dashboard. `profile.php` is left alone, so they can still change their own password and name. And an account that also holds an editor or author role is never redirected, since it has a real reason to be in wp-admin. Administrators are unaffected throughout, and get the same toolbar link for inspecting the page.

Turn the whole behavior off with **Mentor landing page** in the settings.

= Profile photos =

Photos come from the person's WordPress.org profile. WordPress.org serves them through Gravatar, keyed on a hash of the *wordpress.org* account email - which this plugin never sees, so the hash cannot be worked out locally. Rather than scraping each profile page or caching a hash that goes stale the moment someone changes their picture, the plugin uses wordpress.org's own username-to-avatar redirect (`grav-redirect.php`). For anyone with no WordPress.org profile recorded, it falls back to a Gravatar of their program email address.

= Field descriptions come from Airtable =

Every row's Description column shows **the description written on that column in Airtable**, read from Airtable's schema endpoint during each sync. Write or edit a field description in Airtable and it appears on the mentor page after the next sync - no code change.

None of these columns currently carries a description in Airtable, so what shows today is the plugin's own built-in wording ("The school or university the student comes from", and so on). Airtable's description always wins once one exists. Override the built-in text with the `wpcpm_field_descriptions` filter.

Underneath each description is the exact source, for example *Airtable · Students Reports → Slack Name* - which is where to go when a value is wrong or missing. Tutor reads *Airtable · Students → Tutor*, because it is the one field joined from the other table.

Reading descriptions needs the `schema.bases:read` scope on the token. Without it the sync carries on normally, notes it in the report, and shows the built-in descriptions - nothing else is affected.

= Nothing is silently hidden =

Fields are **never dropped when empty**. A blank value shows a muted "Not set" instead of the row disappearing, because a silently dropped row is indistinguishable from the page having forgotten the field.

This surfaces real data problems. For instance, a student whose WordPress.org profile reads `https://someone.blog/` has put a personal blog in that column: there is no WordPress.org username to extract, so the plugin shows "Not set" rather than inventing a handle from the hostname.

= Where the data comes from =

| Shown on the page | Airtable table | Field |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Student name, status | Students Reports | Name, Status |
| Email address | Students Reports | Email |
| Internship start / end | Students Reports | Internship Start Date / Internship End Date |
| Educational institution | Students Reports | Educational institution |
| WordPress.org | Students Reports | WordPress Profile |
| Slack | Students Reports | Slack Name |
| Main contribution team | Students Reports | Main Contribution Team |
| Personal website | Students Reports | Personal Website URL |
| Personal link / 50h link | Students Reports | Personal link / 50h personal link |
| Mentor assignment | Students Reports | Mentor (linked record) |
| **Tutor** | **Students** | **`Tutor `** |

Tutor is the one field that does not exist on Students Reports, so the two tables are joined on email address. Note that the Students column really is named `Tutor ` with a trailing space; dropping it silently returns no tutor at all.

Field *names* are used rather than IDs because Airtable's `filterByFormula` only accepts names. Override them with the `wpcpm_mentors_fields` filter.

= Students module =

**Account provisioning.** Every student in the tracked statuses gets a WordPress account with the Student role, and can read Student-level content and nothing else. Usernames come from the student's WordPress.org profile where Airtable has one and from their email address otherwise - only about seven in ten students have a profile recorded, so the fallback is the common case rather than an edge one. Accounts are matched by their stored record ID and then by email, never by username: a login derived from an email address is far too weak a signal to claim an existing account on.

As with mentors, accounts are created with a random password and **no email is sent**, administrators' roles are never touched, and no account is ever deleted. A student who leaves the program loses the Student role, and with it access to Student-level content, unless you set *When a student leaves the program* to leave it in place.

**The student page.** Activation creates a page called *Student Report Card* at `/student-dashboard/`, gated to Student level. Its sections are *My profile*, *My mentor*, *My course*, *Report form* and *My mentor call*. It renders against the logged-in user, so each student sees only their own. It shows their program (`In Sensei` or `In Sensei 50h`), internship dates, tutor, educational institution, WordPress.org, Slack, contribution team and personal website. *My profile* is a record, not a form: everything a student can change about themselves is asked on the report form, so no column is written from two places.

There is no *Program* column in Airtable, so the program shown is the student's status, which is also what decides which report form applies.

= Reaching the dashboards =

Administrators see a **Dashboards** menu in the toolbar holding every dashboard they can reach. A mentor or student with one page gets a direct link to it instead, and somebody who is both gets both, each labeled as theirs.

An administrator who opens a dashboard before any sync has run is told exactly that, with a link to the screen that runs one - not that they are missing a role.

= The mentor's contact details =

The student page shows the mentor assigned to them, with enough detail to actually reach them: name, email, Slack, WordPress.org, website and GitHub, plus their job line, location and contributor teams.

Airtable's Mentors table holds only a name, an email and a profile URL, so **everything else is read from the mentor's WordPress.org profile** - one request per mentor during the students sync, which is where the mentor cards are built, cached for twelve hours and shared by every student assigned to them. Airtable stays authoritative for name and email; the profile only fills what Airtable has no column for and never overwrites a value that is already there.

A mentor whose profile cannot be read keeps their Airtable details and is named in the sync warnings, rather than the run failing.

= Sync behavior =

The sync is a resumable state machine: roughly 90 mentors, 290 student reports and the whole Students table is more than one request can carry, so each tick works to a time budget, saves its position and starts the next one. Phases run in order - provision mentors, review mentors who are no longer active, read student reports, read tutors, assign - because a mentor not yet paged in would otherwise look inactive.

It runs every three hours and on demand from **WPCredits Program → Mentors → Sync mentors now**.

= Sync progress =

A run never leaves you guessing whether it is working. Starting a sync returns immediately - no long blank request - and the Mentors screen then shows a live readout: a progress bar, the current step ("Step 2 of 5"), what that step has achieved so far ("91 mentors read · 12 created · 79 linked"), and a clock counting up every second.

The screen both reports the progress *and* drives the work: each poll performs one slice, so the sync advances even where WP-Cron is unreliable, and the numbers move every few seconds rather than every eighteen. Cron remains the fallback if you close the tab, and a lock prevents the two from processing the same page twice. With JavaScript off the page refreshes itself instead and cron does the work.

If a run genuinely stops advancing for more than two minutes, the screen says so rather than spinning forever. `wp wpcredits sync-mentors` prints the same percentage and counts, one line per slice.

= Tools: Mentor Status Checker =

Was the standalone **Credits Program Mentor Checker** plugin; now a tool at **WPCredits Program → Tools → Mentor Status Checker**. Folded in so there is one Airtable connection, one settings screen and one place to look. **If you were running the standalone plugin, deactivate it** - otherwise both schedule their own weekly check and read the same WordPress.org profiles twice. The tool says so on screen if it finds the old plugin still active.

It reads every mentor whose Airtable status is `Vetted - positive`, looks up their WordPress.org contribution history, and moves those who have completed the *WordPress Credits Mentor's Course* to `Active`.

* **Report only** is the default and never writes anything. A separate button promotes, and each row also has its own **Promote**.
* Promotion **re-reads the record immediately before writing**, so a status somebody else changed in the meantime is left alone.
* A mentor whose history is longer than the page cap is reported as *could not check*, never as *not completed* - a false negative would leave them waiting.
* The completion phrase and the course link must appear in the **same** history entry, so a mentor who merely blogged about the course is not counted as having taken it.
* Runs are batched, with a progress bar, live counts and an ETA. The whole queue is listed up front and each row resolves in place, so the screen is never blank while work is happening.
* A weekly automatic run is available, off by default - as is letting that run promote.

Promoting writes to Airtable, so it needs the `data.records:write` scope. Everything else is read-only.

`wp wpcredits check-mentors [--promote]` does the same from the command line.

= Requirements =

An Airtable Personal Access Token on the WPCredits base with:

* `data.records:read` - **required.** Reading mentors, students and tutors.
* `data.records:write` - **required by the Mentor Status Checker.** Changing a mentor's status when you promote them. Without it the tool still runs in report-only mode, but promoting fails with a 403.
* `schema.bases:read` - optional. Reading each column's description from Airtable; without it the built-in descriptions are shown.

The scopes are listed on the settings screen too. They cannot be verified from WordPress without writing to the base, so if a promotion fails with a permissions error the plugin names the scope that is missing rather than passing Airtable's message through unchanged.

The token is stored in the database, is only ever rendered masked, and is never sent to the browser.

== Installation ==

1. Upload and activate the plugin. Activation registers the roles, grants the program capabilities to Administrator, and creates the *My Students* page.
2. Go to **WPCredits Program → Settings** and add your Airtable Personal Access Token. The base and table IDs are pre-filled.
3. Go to **WPCredits Program → Mentors** and choose **Sync mentors now**.
4. Review the sync report, then invite mentors - individually, or by enabling invitation emails before a sync.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does syncing email anyone? =

No. Accounts are created silently with a random password. Invitations are sent only when you enable the setting or press **Send invite** for a specific mentor.

= What happens to a mentor who is no longer Active in Airtable? =

Their Mentor role is removed and their student list cleared, so they can no longer read Mentor-level content. The account itself is kept. Set *When a mentor is no longer active* to *Leave the role in place* to disable this.

= A mentor has no WordPress.org profile in Airtable. What happens? =

They are skipped and named in the sync report's warnings, because the username is derived from that profile. The same applies to a mentor with no valid email address - WordPress cannot create an account without one.

= Can mentors see each other's students? =

No. The page renders against the logged-in user. Only accounts with `wpcpm_manage_program` - Administrators - can view another mentor's list.

= Does uninstalling delete the mentor accounts? =

No. Uninstall removes settings, sync state, access-level meta and the custom roles, and moves affected accounts to Subscriber. Sponsor offers, their code pools and the pools' locks, and the claims meta on every account, are deleted with them. Accounts are never deleted.

== Changelog ==

= 1.105.0 =

* The Track Builder edits a track's questions. Under a track's properties its questions are listed by group; each is edited on a screen of its own, moved up or down within its group, or removed, and a question is added to a group with its Airtable column, its words and its control.
* A question whose column another track also writes says so and names the track. Rewording keeps the column shared; changing its control or its choices gives this track a column of its own, named after the track, so the other tracks are not changed.
* A question that has been published keeps its column and its control, because the column in Airtable holds what students have written, in that shape. Its wording can still change; to ask it differently, remove it and add a new question.
* The line above the questions says how many columns publishing would create, from a reading of the base kept for fifteen minutes. The publish screen still reads the base afresh before anything is created.
* A track that was never published can be deleted from the track list. One that has been published is kept as the record of what was created in Airtable, and can only be unpublished.
* Publishing refuses a select question whose Airtable column does not offer every one of its choices, naming the missing ones, since Airtable's API cannot add a choice; and it refuses a track in the trash before reading the base.
* Unpublishing a track returns to its publish screen rather than to the list.

= 1.104.0 =

* A track is published from the Track Builder. Before anything happens the screen says what would: which columns Airtable is missing, which are ready, what the table would come to, and anything that would stop the publish, in the same words the editor uses.
* With a schema token configured, publishing creates the columns a track's questions name, one at a time, and a run stopped by Airtable carries on from where it left off when it is pressed again. Without one, the screen lists the columns for somebody to create by hand and waits for them.
* What the site cannot do is a checklist of three, each ticked by whoever did it and recorded with their name: the reports automation, the welcome email, and the two Status choices no token can add. Ticking the first is what lets an institution import offer the track.
* A live track can be checked against Airtable at any time, which catches a column renamed in the base before students write into nothing, and taken off the live site once nobody is on it.
* Publishing a built-in track no longer puts its status back into "Currently mentoring", so one taken out in Settings stays out.
* The track list counts the students on every track in one pass rather than one per row, and saving the settings compiles from the settings screen rather than from anything else that saves them.

= 1.103.0 =

* The Track Builder screen, under Modules: every program track with its state, how many students are on it, its Learn course, who published it last, and what the last compile left out and why. Nothing on this screen reaches students; publishing a track arrives in the next release.
* A track's properties are edited here, and a new track starts as a copy of one that exists, questions and all, with a name, a status and a key of its own. What the editor refuses is exactly what publishing would refuse, so the two screens can never disagree.
* A built-in track that its hand-written form still runs is read-only, shows how its definition compares with that form, and offers the switch in both directions while the two are identical. A built-in draft that a release has left behind refreshes itself from the seed the plugin ships, and can be refreshed from its row.
* Saving the program settings compiles the tracks again, so a status moved out of "Currently mentoring" reaches both the live site and the list at once.

= 1.102.2 =

* The guide builder turns a Markdown link in a section into a link. It had no link mark, so a section that wrote one printed it at the reader: the feedback section has shown a raw `[#123](https://github.com/WordPress/WPCredits/issues/123)` since it was written, and now shows the link. Only http and https addresses are accepted, and an address carrying whitespace, a quote or an angle bracket is left as text, because the address is the one place a section's prose reaches an HTML attribute.
* The Student Duplicate Finder's section now points at the separate page explaining how to stop duplicates being created in Airtable at all, which the finder does not do.

= 1.102.1 =

* The program manager guide's Student Duplicate Finder section is now a guide to running it rather than a description of it: why duplicates should be deleted from the finder and never by hand in Airtable, what a scan does, six steps for working through the list, a table of every reason a row is held back with what to do about each, what a press of Delete checks again, the 30-day copy and that there is no automatic restore, and the switch. No code changed.

= 1.102.0 =

* New module: the Student Duplicate Finder (WPCredits Program → Modules), from docs/specs/2026-09-11-student-duplicate-finder-design.md. It lists every student with more than one row in the Airtable tables Students, Students Reports and Feedback, proposes which rows to delete, and deletes the rows a program manager ticks and then confirms on a second page. It scans every three hours, 150 minutes into the cycle the syncs share, and on Scan now; a scan writes nothing to Airtable, and a failed one keeps the last list.
* Nothing is deleted until a manager turns on "Deleting duplicates" under Settings: the finder ships switched off. Before a delete it reads the rows from Airtable again and asks every question again, refuses a row the site points at, a row that changed since the scan and the last row an address has in a table, keeps a sealed copy of each row on the site, and deletes children first: Feedback, then Students Reports, then Students. A daily job erases the copies after 30 days; the log of what was deleted, by whom and when, stays, without names or addresses.
* The Administrator Dashboard gains a thirteenth tile, Duplicated students, and a small card linking to the finder. New underneath: `WPCPM_Airtable::delete_records()`, ten records a request, and `WPCPM_Request::posted_list()`.

= 1.101.1 =

* Invitations: nobody is sent a second set-your-password invitation within 15 minutes of the last one. Each invitation replaces the link in the one before it, and on 8 and 9 September 2026, while a class was signing in for the first time, one student was sent 17 invitations in two days and students opening an older email kept landing on "Your password reset link appears to be invalid". Resend invite on the Students and Mentors screens now refuses inside that window and says why, the invitation queue passes over anybody invited in it, and the notice after a resend says that only the newest email works.
* The invitation email says the same to the person reading it: each new invitation or password email replaces the link in the ones before it, so use the newest.

* Track Builder, phase T2a (docs/plans/2026-09-11-track-builder-t2a.md): the definitions the Track Builder screen of phase T2b will work on. Nothing changes on any page. The first request after the update puts the four built-in tracks into the Track Builder as drafts, from the seed definitions the plugin now ships in `includes/tracks/seeds/`, each held byte for byte to its hand-written form by `bin/test-track-definitions.php`; their PHP keeps running them.
* Publishing a track records its definition as published, and the live site compiles that copy, never the latest saved one, so an edit reaches students only once it is published. Every compile checks each published track again and leaves out one the rules now refuse, or one claiming a status or key another track holds; a new track can no longer take one of the four built-in statuses.
* The rules are stricter: a track's name may not be another track's name or status, nor its status another track's name, a column one capital or space away from a column the syncs own is refused, a whole number is refused as a column name however it is written, and lengths are counted in characters. `WPCPM_Student_Report_Form::fields()` now hands the Track Builder `builtin_fields()`, and the three alumni answers carry `hide_from_institution` in the PHP as well.
* New underneath, with no screen yet: publishing and unpublishing, the switch between a built-in track's PHP and its definition (allowed only while the two are identical), a log of both, and `wp wpcredits seed-tracks`. A built-in track cannot be edited while its PHP runs it. The uninstall also removes any Track Builder form the index lost track of.

= 1.100.0 =

* Groundwork for the Track Builder, the module that will let Program Administrators create and edit program tracks on the site (phase T1 of the design in docs/specs/2026-09-10-track-builder-design.md). Nothing changes on any page: while no track has been made on the site, every program map, form and card answers exactly as before. New underneath: the private `wpcpm_track` post type, whose definition is kept in revisions; the options the live site will read a published track from; and the rules a track's definition has to pass, every one of which accepts all 115 questions of the four existing Student Report Card forms.
* `WPCPM_Program::track()` is filtered (`wpcpm_program_tracks`), the program map now carries each track's Learn WordPress course ID (`course_ids()` and `course_id()`, filtered as `wpcpm_program_course_ids`), and it names its two states on no track (`states()`).
* The Administrator Dashboard's Programs running card and the Institutions Link control's automation guard now ask the program map for the tracks instead of keeping lists of their own, so a track added later reaches both without a change to either.

= 1.99.3 =

* Linking a Students row to an institution from the reconciliation card is refused when the row carries a mentor at `Designer Track`, as it already was for the other four statuses the Airtable automation `Add students to Students Reports and Feedback` watches: writing the institution onto such a row completes the automation's conditions and can create a second Students Reports row. The Designer Track shipped in 1.98.2 without joining that list, so until now those rows were guarded by the address check alone. The automation was read again on 10 September 2026 and watches five statuses; the suite checks all five.

= 1.99.2 =

* The Designer Track report form: the project lesson (the contribution team, the project summary and the second project, under the heading "Define and begin developing your contribution project") now sits where the Learn course places it, after the eight practical lessons and directly above "Your reflection posts", so the portfolio runs straight into the first practical lesson (the product owner, 8 September 2026). The same 49 fields.

= 1.99.1 =

* The Designer Track report form, two changes asked for on 8 September 2026. The lesson heading "Define and begin developing your contribution project" now opens over the contribution team list, so the team, the project summary and the second project all read as that lesson's questions. The alumni program section reads exactly as the Developer Track's: the meetings and discussions question opens it under the short "Alumni Program" heading, then how the student plans to keep contributing, the personal address and the mentoring opt-in follow, and the event link after them keeps its own heading. The set is 49 fields.

= 1.99.0 =
* **The deep check fixes.** The fifty findings of the 7 September 2026 deep check of 1.98.1 - one high, eight medium and forty-one low - are closed, and every fix ships with a check that fails on the code before it. With theme 1.24.3.
* **A sponsor member keeps nothing after a detach.** Removing a person from a sponsor now drops the posting capabilities last, so the role write can no longer put them back from a stale copy of the account, and a one-time repair on the first admin page after the update takes `edit_posts`, `delete_posts` and `upload_files` off the accounts an older detach left holding them. The history the detach leaves behind grants nothing on its own, and the Sponsor Dashboard no longer waves an account past the dashboard because it can write posts.
* **A manager acting for a sponsor writes to the sponsor the page shows.** The logo and the roster take the record the manager opened rather than the one the manager's own account is attached to, and Remove says so when the logo on the page came from Airtable and there is nothing here to remove.
* **Offer codes and claims.** A pasted list of codes is measured before it is read, so a paste too large to accept is refused instead of filling the pool; a paste refused on a new offer says the paste was refused and leaves no half-made offer behind, rather than reporting an offer created without codes. Claiming honors the Tools switches, so an offer switched off for an audience cannot be claimed by that audience through a link.
* **The agreement, the sync and the queue.** Withdrawing a Collaboration Agreement never writes an older status over the newer one the base already holds. The sponsors sync refuses a read that has lost records until a second run confirms the table really is smaller, and says so.
* **The application forms.** A second send from the same person moments after the first is held rather than filed as spam; the ceilings are keyed on the /64 for an IPv6 address, so a visitor cannot walk around them; a held row stores no uploaded file; and held rows are purged on the rejected window on both the sponsor and the institution form.
* **The institution agreement option and the Administrator Dashboard.** The agreement option never stores an empty Airtable status, which read as an open gate. The dashboard's decided lists are bounded, its Recently closed list is dated by when each request was closed and says so, and the arrows on a movable module belong to the modules the page actually draws, on the Institution Dashboard and the Student Report Card alike.
* **The front end.** A form's buttons are released when the reader comes back to the page with Back, focus stays on the module that was just moved, a move the site refused is put back where it was, and the Administrator Dashboard reads at the 14px floor with the contrast the other dashboards have. One table rule now dresses every dashboard.
* The seed fixture and the suites are synthetic throughout, so nothing on the public mirror carries a real record ID, name, address or organization: the list of what to replace is kept as hashes rather than as the names themselves, and the check reads the whole of `bin/` and `docs/`. `bin/check-spelling.php` refuses a root that is not a plugin tree instead of passing silently, `bin/check-standards.sh` exits 0 when it is clean, and `truncate_ip()` is byte-true for compressed and mapped addresses.
* A mentor who also works for a sponsor is sent to the Mentor Report Card at login again, instead of landing on the wp-admin dashboard because writing the sponsor's posts looked like editing the site. A file of codes with a blank line between each one is measured by its codes, not by its lines, so a full pool is accepted. Two moves refused in a row both put the page back, and focus returns to the arrow that was pressed.

= 1.98.3 =
* The Designer Track report form, four changes asked for on 8 September 2026: every course grade the base holds is on the form (the three WordPress User levels under "Complete one of the following courses" right after the required Beginner WordPress Designer mark, then the Beginner WordPress Developer and Intermediate Theme Developer marks under "Optional courses"); the project summary sits directly under the contribution team, before the practical lessons; the second contribution project follows it, as on the Developer Track form; and the two alumni program questions stand in their own section, under the Learn lesson's heading, between the meetings question and the event link, which now carries its own heading. The set is 48 fields.

= 1.98.2 =
* **The Designer Track, a fourth program.** The Airtable status `Designer Track` is a track the way the Developer Track is: its own chip on a Mentor Report Card, its own Learn course button, a 150-hour target and a report form of its own. The form follows the Learn course lesson by lesson - the onboarding grades and the portfolio, then the eight practical lessons each with its notes and its screenshots, then the contribution project, the reflection posts and the closing post. Students on the track are fetched from the first sync after the update, without anybody editing the status list by hand.
* **Two new controls on the report form.** A choice list, written to Airtable as the option's own name and cleared by choosing nothing; and a screenshot upload - PNG, JPEG or WebP up to 4 MB, twenty a day per student - kept in the Media Library and copied to Airtable, so the Student Report Card shows this site's copy rather than an Airtable attachment URL, which expires within hours. Choosing a new file replaces what is there and Remove deletes it from both places.
* **Every Airtable sync on a three-hour clock.** The mentors, institutions and sponsors syncs leave the daily schedule and join the students sync's recurrence, staggered half an hour, one hour, an hour and a half and two hours into a shared cycle so no two land in the same run of the scheduler. Each sync moves its own event on the first request after the update - a daily event is cleared and rescheduled - so nothing has to be deactivated and reactivated. The daily housekeeping jobs and the weekly Mentor Status Checker are unchanged.
* The Airtable fixture gains the track's twenty-one practical columns, so the fixture and reference checks know them; the students, settings and administrator guides are rewritten for the new cadence and the new track.

= 1.98.1 =
* **Clean-up.** The two application forms share one stash-and-redirect class. The Sponsors menu bubble is counted once a minute and forgets its count the moment a row changes. A dwell token has one shape (a token minted before 6 September 2026 is refused; every one of them expired that day). Recently decided is bounded by a decision-time index, backfilled once. The docs build escapes a section's text. The institution agreement retries a failed Airtable write nightly. A refused image store leaves no file behind. A dead phpcs annotation and a dead class are gone.

= 1.98.0 =
* **The Sponsors module, phase six: the guide and the queues.** Sponsors have a guide of their own, composed by the docs build as a fourth audience and published on the handbook beside the other three; the Sponsor Dashboard's guide button points at it.
* **Three cards on the Administrator Dashboard.** Offers running low lists every live pool under the threshold its sponsor set, emptiest first, linked to the sponsor's Offers and codes card. New interests lists what sponsors sent from their dashboards in the last thirty days, as they wrote it. Sponsors counts the Approved sponsors, how many hold an account, the offers live today and the claims since the semester began.
* **The whole application on the card.** Each item of the Sponsor applications card folds the answers, the logo files and the base matches under Read the application; the decisions stay where they were.
* **A twelfth tile and a fourth sync.** The needs-attention strip counts the pools running low, and the Syncs card lists the sponsors sync.

= 1.97.6 =
* Sponsor Dashboard: a live offer's state sentence reads "Live: shown on the site."

= 1.97.5 =
* Sponsor Dashboard: the state block of an open offer no longer wears the state chip's class, so it is a block and not a pill. With theme 1.23.23.

= 1.97.4 =
* Sponsor Dashboard: an open offer reads as text first: its details, then Edit this offer (which reveals the form and Save offer), then its state under a title of its own with one sentence on what the state means and the moves (Switch on, Pause, Resume, End this offer), then the codes. With theme 1.23.22.

= 1.97.3 =
* Sponsor Dashboard: inside an open offer, Add codes and Void unclaimed codes stand on one line too.

= 1.97.2 =
* Sponsor Dashboard: inside an open offer, Save offer, Pause and End this offer stand on one line, and the codes forms sit under a line of their own, 24px down. With theme 1.23.21.

= 1.97.1 =
* Sponsor Dashboard: the Offers and codes card is two columns. The new-offer form sits first, on the left; the offers sit on the right, each folded to its title and its counts, under "Active offers" and, for the ended and expired ones, under "Ended and expired offers". With theme 1.23.20.

= 1.97.0 =
* **The Sponsors module, phase five: the application form.** A company applies to sponsor the program on this site, at /sponsor-application/, with the Airtable form's eight questions in its order and wording, two optional logo files through the plugin's image handler, and the seven guards the institution form runs: a honeypot, a signed single-use dwell token, five submissions an hour per address, forty a day site-wide before the rest are held, consent as a precondition with the sentence, the policy and its version recorded, link counting, and a ceiling on acknowledgements. Off until "Applications from sponsors" is switched on. The applicant gets an acknowledgement with a reference; the managers get the facts and a link. Duplicates are flagged twice and never merged: another open application naming the company or the address, and a sponsor the index already holds under the name or the website.
* **Six decisions, on two screens.** The Sponsors screen lists the applications waiting, oldest first, opens one with its answers, its logo files, what was agreed to and what the base already holds, and offers Approve, Send this question (with the manager's address to reply to), Reject (a short acknowledgement with no reason), Reject as spam (silent), Put back in the queue and Delete for good; the Administrator Dashboard offers the same six on a Sponsor applications card and counts the queue in its strip. Approve creates the Airtable record with Status Approved and, in the same press, the account through the shipped provisioning path, the company's category, the logo record, the first offer in draft and the welcome through the invitation queue; when Airtable refuses, nothing else happens and pressing again starts clean.
* **Retention** reuses the three institution application settings; a spam or rejected application's logo files are deleted with it, an approved one's stay as the sponsor's logo.
* `WPCPM_Form_Guard` is the extraction: the seven checks both public forms now run, with its own suite; the institution form is rewired to it and its suite is unchanged. `WPCPM_Sponsors::provision_account()` is the account half of Create account, shared with the approval. The Sponsors menu entry now carries a bubble counting applications, agreements and posts waiting.
* **After go-live, one manual step:** change the form link on the handbook page by hand to the site's page at /sponsor-application/. Nothing else is by hand.

= 1.96.8 =
* Sponsor Dashboard: the Usage card draws the last twelve months as a bar chart above the table, one bar per offer and month, in place of the two lines of numbers; the numbers stay in the chart's label, in each bar's title and in the CSV. With theme 1.23.19.

= 1.96.7 =
* Sponsor Dashboard: the profile card is two columns, the company's details on the left and its logo on the right. With theme 1.23.16.

= 1.96.6 =
* Sponsor Dashboard: the profile and the logo are one card, "Your company profile and logo", the logo block under the profile form; a saved or removed logo lands back on that card. With theme 1.23.15.

= 1.96.5 =
* Institution Dashboard: the "Read from the program records" line closes the page under its own hairline, as the Student Report Card ends, instead of closing the roster. With theme 1.23.13.

= 1.96.4 =
* Institution Dashboard: the page under the header is three movable modules - Students, Semester report, Representatives and agreement - each with an eyebrow title and a sentence saying what it is for, and the same two arrows the Student Report Card has; the order is the institution's own, arranged by a representative or by a program manager viewing the page. The module order code is shared with the Student Report Card (`WPCPM_Module_Order`). With theme 1.23.10.

= 1.96.3 =
* Mentor Report Card: the ordering sentence sits under the "Currently mentoring" heading inside the same row, so the search beside them centers on that sentence, and the hairline above the row stays. With theme 1.23.3.

= 1.96.2 =
* Mentor Report Card: the student search sits in the "Currently mentoring" heading row, on the right, rather than in a band of its own above the groups. With theme 1.23.2.

= 1.96.1 =
* Administrator Dashboard: a Sponsor Collaboration Agreements card, after the sponsor posts, with every signed copy waiting for review (who uploaded it, when, its size, what the scan noticed, Download, Accept, Return with a note) and the agreements out of force with the way back; the needs-attention strip counts the documents to review. The same handlers as the wp-admin Sponsors screen, and a decision taken here lands back here. With theme 1.23.1.

= 1.96.0 =
* **The Sponsors module, phase four: logo and agreement.** A sponsor uploads its own logo, in color and optionally in white, on the Sponsor Dashboard. Every byte goes through the plugin's image handler (PNG, JPEG or WebP by content, at least 200 pixels wide, re-saved through WordPress's editor; SVG refused), five uploads a day per company, and the attachments' public URLs replace Airtable's `Logo` so the base shows what the site shows. Remove takes the logo out of the site and out of the program records in the same breath, and deletes nothing from the Media Library. An upload that PHP dropped for its size, or that did not finish, is told so.
* **The sponsor's Collaboration Agreement.** A private `wpcpm_sponsor_agr` post type with the Collaboration Agreement's shape and none of its gate: a sponsor's dashboard, offers and codes work with or without one. A signed PDF is checked for its name, its magic bytes, its type and a bounded stream scan before anything is stored, kept encrypted in the private store, and offered back only as an attachment under a name this site chose. A program manager accepts, returns with a note, revokes with a note, reinstates, or records an agreement the program already holds with a Drive link, from the Agreements card on the Sponsors screen; `Agreement Status`, `Agreement Accepted On` and `Agreement Document` are written in one PATCH each time, and when the site row cannot be written after the base was told, the manager is told exactly that. A withdrawn file is deleted the moment it is withdrawn, and a returned one by a daily run after `agreement_discard_days`, scheduled on every load and not only on activation, and never on a date the site cannot read; accepted, superseded and revoked ones are kept on uninstall and listed in the same mailed manifest as the institutions' files.
* `WPCPM_Pdf_Check` is the PDF scanner both agreement classes now run: the magic bytes, the `finfo` type, WordPress's name-and-type map, and the bounded inflate of every `FlateDecode` stream, with its own suite. The Collaboration Agreement keeps its published names as delegates and its suite is unchanged; its own discard run gained the same never-on-an-unreadable-date guard.
* With theme 1.23.0.

= 1.95.14 =
* Mentor Report Card: the program updates and announcements with the resources lead the page, above the mentor's calls, as they do on the Student Report Card. With theme 1.22.15.

= 1.95.13 =
* Student Report Card: the in-place move now saves. The script posted to the form's action property, which the hidden action field shadows, so the order was never kept; it reads the attribute.

= 1.95.12 =
* Student Report Card: the modules move in place, without a page load, and the order is the student's own - remembered for that student only, arranged by the student on their own card or by a program manager viewing it. Program updates and announcements with the resources come first until they are moved. Tools from our sponsors is a module of its own. The arrows fall back to a plain form without JavaScript.

= 1.95.11 =
* Student Report Card: the four blocks under the profile and mentor columns - My course, the report and feedback forms, My mentor call, and the program updates with the resources - are movable modules. A program manager moves one up or down with the two arrows at its top right, the way the block editor moves blocks, and every student sees the new order. Tools from our sponsors travel with the updates and resources. With theme 1.22.11.

= 1.95.10 =
* Sponsor Dashboard: each group says under its heading what its cards do; the descriptive first paragraph inside the Your profile, Offers and codes, Usage, Mentors looking for a sponsor and Posts cards is gone, and only the notes that belong to a state remain. With theme 1.22.10.

= 1.95.9 =
* Sponsor Dashboard: the group headings wear the eyebrow style of "Program updates and announcements" and "Resources" and sit inside their group, under its line. With theme 1.22.9.

= 1.95.8 =
* Sponsor Dashboard: the three groups of cards carry headings - "Your company", "What you offer", "Mentors" - so they read as groups. With theme 1.22.7.

= 1.95.7 =
* wp-admin for a sponsor's accounts: the category lists show their own category and its Sponsors parent alone (the editor's list, Quick Edit, the classic box), and the Posts screen loses the category filter, since every post there is theirs.

= 1.95.6 =
* Sponsor Dashboard: the cards in three groups - the sponsor itself (Your profile, People), what it offers (Offers and codes, Usage, What else would you like to support?, Posts), then its mentors (Your mentors, Mentors looking for a sponsor).

= 1.95.5 =
* Administrator Dashboard: a "Sponsor posts to review" card and its tile in the attention strip. Each pending sponsor post shows its company, its author and when it was submitted, with Preview, Publish and a folded "Return with a note" that says what it does (the post goes back to the sponsor's account as a draft and the note is mailed to its author). A decision taken there returns to the dashboard with its sentence. With theme 1.22.6.

= 1.95.4 =
* Sponsor Dashboard, Posts card: the list of posts takes the Updates list's shape and classes (a bold title, the state and date on one muted line under it, a hairline between), exactly like "Program updates and announcements" on the Student Report Card and the Mentor Report Card. The manager's Publish and Return controls are off the card: the sponsor's accounts submit, a program manager publishes from wp-admin, and the Administrator Dashboard's queue (a later phase) will carry Publish and Return with the note. With theme 1.22.5.

= 1.95.3 =
* Sponsor Dashboard, Posts card: shorter leads; the actions in one row; each post's title, state and date in one head line; a manager's decision is one row of Preview, Publish and a folded "Return with a note" whose form opens only when chosen, with the level hint under it. With theme 1.22.2.

= 1.95.2 =
* Sponsor Dashboard, Posts card: the way into wp-admin's Posts screen sits beside Write a post for a sponsor's accounts, and a program manager gets the same screen filtered to the sponsor's category. With theme 1.22.1.

= 1.95.1 =
* The author of a post reads it whatever its access level: a sponsor's accounts can open their own published guides, which sit at the Students and mentors level while the accounts hold the sponsor marker alone. Found on the live demonstration of 1.95.0.

= 1.95.0 =
* **The Sponsors module, phase three: sponsor posts.** A sponsor's accounts write posts in the site's editor with Contributor-level capabilities added per account (`edit_posts`, `delete_posts`, `upload_files`; never on the role, never `publish_posts`), switched per sponsor on the Sponsors screen and applied when an account is attached or detached. A member's post is pending, dated now, their own, in the Sponsors category and the company's child category, at the new "Students and mentors" access level, and stamped with the sponsor, whatever the editor said; the block editor's REST save is pinned the same way. Members see their own posts and media only, upload images only, and lose the access box, Comments and Tools. A program manager publishes from the editor or from the Posts card on the Sponsor Dashboard, or returns a post as a draft with a note that is kept on the post and mailed to the author.
* For a sponsor's accounts, every wp-admin query (the screens' own and admin-ajax's) lists their own posts and files only; oEmbed names the company and answers nothing for a gated post; publishing from the card stamps the publish moment on the post.
* Access levels: "Students and mentors", readable with either marker capability; the Updates column of the Student Report Card and the Mentor Report Card lists it.
* Tools from our sponsors: a sponsor's published guides are listed under its first offer, for readers the level admits. A sponsor post carries the company as its author and opens with a byline box; the author archive was already closed.
* Categories: "Sponsors" and one child per company, created on first use, renamed by the sync when the company is renamed in Airtable, kept on uninstall.
* With theme 1.22.0.

= 1.94.7 =
* Student Report Card: the sentence that opens a run of marks ("Complete one of the following courses", "Optional courses", "Your contribution team and project", "Your reflection posts") is a lesson sub-heading like "Enter your final grade, 0 to 100": capitals and the rule above, one treatment for every run.
* Mentor Report Card: the sentence saying how the student list is ordered sits above the list, under its heading, instead of after the list under a rule.
* Institution Dashboard: each student row carries the same 44px portrait the Mentor Report Card shows for that student; the People card shows the colleague-invite flow (invite a colleague by email, see and resend or cancel pending invitations) that the module already had, in place of the sentence saying it would ship later.
* Institution Dashboard: a student's portrait comes from their WordPress.org profile only, with no Gravatar fallback, because the page withholds the address the fallback is derived from.
* The Institutions screen's note about an institution's pending invitations now says where to find them: the institution's own dashboard, where they can be resent or canceled.
* With theme 1.21.0, the dashboard consistency pass of 6 September 2026: one button size on every dashboard, the Mentor Report Card's band, ordering note and past-students box aligned, the Administrator Dashboard's rows centered on their buttons, the Institution Dashboard's student rows laid out like the Mentor Report Card's.

= 1.94.6 =
* Student Report Card: every hint is tied to its control with an id and `aria-describedby`, the team list included. A mentor or a program manager reading a student's card now sees text rows - a label and a value, "Not filled in" for an empty answer, and links that open in a new tab - instead of disabled boxes, with the team tiles kept so the chosen teams still show. The marks stack their label over the box, with the heading above a run of marks stating the scale, "Enter your final grade, 0 to 100"; the card's last hairline divider is gone. The reflection posts are named "Your reflection posts", and on the Developer Track the team and project pair is named "Your contribution team and project". Whoever reads the card gets the line breaks of the final project report back, so a multi-paragraph write-up reads as it was written.
* Sponsor Dashboard, offers: the codes box and the file field on the offer form each carry their own hint under them, described to a screen reader; the fixed kind's note stays a plain note, not a description; and the Title field says "Required" in its label.
* Institution Dashboard: required fields on the import form and the application form say "Required" in their labels.
* The plugin's own stylesheets gain the `.wpcpm-field__required` mark and the `.wpcpm-field--read` rows.
* With theme 1.20.0, phases two and three of the type and color review of 5 September 2026.

= 1.94.5 =
* Student Report Card: the "My mentor" card looks as it did before 1.94.1 again. The Sponsor Dashboard's mentor tiles had reused the card's class name, and because every dashboard page loads every dashboard stylesheet, the tile rules reached the student's card. The tiles are their own block now (`wpcpm-mentor-tile`), and only the Sponsor Dashboard shows mentors that way. With theme 1.19.4.

= 1.94.4 =
* Form controls in the plugin's own stylesheets (the Institution Dashboard's student and import forms, the application form, the mentor notes box) take a control border at 3:1 against the page instead of the card hairline, the boundary WCAG 1.4.11 asks for. With theme 1.19.3, which does the same for the Sponsor Dashboard's and the Administrator Dashboard's controls.

= 1.94.3 =
* Student Report Card and Mentor Report Card: the sentence that opens a run of marks ("Complete one of the following courses", "Optional courses") is a heading printed above the run, not a note under it, and lesson sub-headings are headings for a screen reader too. Hints and notes in the plugin's own stylesheet are one step under the body size instead of two.
* Sponsor Dashboard: the number and date fields on the offer forms take the same width as the text fields.
* Writing: US English throughout the interface, as the WordPress writing style guide asks (program, color, canceled, enrollment), and `bin/check-standards.sh` now fails on the British spellings.
* With theme 1.19.2, phase one of the type and color review of 5 September 2026.

= 1.94.2 =
* Student Report Card and Mentor Report Card: the team icons on the tiles are 24px, half of 1.94.1's size, on the owner's request after seeing them on the page.

= 1.94.1 =
* Sponsor Dashboard: "Your mentors" and "Mentors looking for a sponsor" are two sections of mentor cards, the shape the Credits Program Mentors plugin gives the program's mentors: photo, name linked to the WordPress.org profile, how many students the mentor works with now and worked with before, and their expertise.
* Offers and codes: a pool's codes can be uploaded as a .txt or .csv file (one code per line, or the first column) as well as pasted, on the new-offer form and on the pool's own box, so a pool and its codes are one step. The kind of offer is two plain choices, and the form shows only the box that belongs to the kind chosen.
* Student Report Card and Mentor Report Card: the contribution teams are tiles across the full width of the Project section, the team icon three times its old size and the tick blue once chosen; the project questions follow under the list, full width.
* Administrator Dashboard: the page's own text takes the dashboards' inset and the note fields fit their column (with theme 1.19.1).

= 1.94.0 =
* **The Sponsors module, phase two: offers, codes and "Tools from our sponsors".** A sponsor publishes offers from the Sponsor Dashboard: a pool of one-time codes pasted in (all or nothing, refused by line number, encrypted at rest with the site key) or one shared code or link, with what you get, how to redeem it, a link, the audience (current students always; mentors and the program team when the sponsor says so), a low-stock threshold and an optional last day. The first offer is seeded from the base on provisioning (or from a button on the Sponsors screen) and mirrors its text, instructions and link back to the base on every save. Current students claim a code from a new "Tools from our sponsors" section on their own Student Report Card (mentors on theirs when the program switches it on; managers see every live offer on the Administrator Dashboard); a second press returns the same code, a code once given stays under "Your codes", and "Report a problem" tells the sponsor's program manager. The sponsor's Usage card counts claims by month and offer, with a CSV; the Sponsors screen lists who claimed, for support, with a Void button. Below the threshold, the sponsor and the manager are mailed once. Nobody is ever sent a code by mail, sponsors never see a name, and nothing about a claim reaches Airtable.
* `WPCPM_Secret`, extracted from the private files store: the site key, the seal and the unseal every store uses, plus a base64 form for options and a keyed fingerprint for finding duplicates without unsealing.
* Settings: the two Tools switches and the low-stock default. `forms.js` selects a claimed code on click.

= 1.93.2 =
* The Sponsor Dashboard takes the Institution Dashboard's spacing everywhere the two pages share a shape. Each card is now a section with the rule above it and the room the institution's cards have, and the disclosure inside it only folds; the switcher, the message under it, the program-contact block, the sub-headings, the list rows and the foot of the page carry the institution's values, copied value for value into the sponsor stylesheet. Theme 1.18.2 stops sizing those parts itself.

= 1.93.1 =
* The Sponsor Dashboard's identity block takes the Institution Dashboard's rules for the details beside the logo: the name at the size the institution's name has, the website a plain line, the facts a quiet line each. Theme 1.18.1 stops sizing them itself, so the two headers read as the same header.

= 1.93.0 =
* **The Sponsors module, phase one: accounts, sync and the Sponsor Dashboard.** A nightly sync reads the Team Members and Sponsors tables into an index and copies each Approved sponsor's logo into the Media Library (an Airtable attachment URL expires within hours). A program manager creates each sponsor's account one at a time from the Sponsors screen, from the contact address, with the welcome through the invitation queue; accounts are attached and removed there too, and the base's Dashboard account checkbox follows. Sponsors get a Sponsor Dashboard at /sponsor-dashboard/: logo, name, website, product type and contact; their contact at the program; a profile they can save back to Airtable through an allowlist with an audit row; their sponsored mentors with student counts and never a student's name; the mentors looking for a sponsor, with one press to say they would like to sponsor one; and a form to say what else they would like to support, which mails their program contact and appends a dated line to the base's Sponsorship interests column. One policy decides every sponsor action; every refusal of a member is metered, twenty a day.
* Extracted for both modules: `WPCPM_Refusal_Meter` (the institution roster's twenty-a-day lock) and `WPCPM_Image_Upload` (the one image handler: PNG, JPEG or WebP, re-saved through WordPress's editor, never SVG). The audit log gains a sponsor key. The welcome mail, the settings and the audience maps know sponsors. The mentors sync keeps a sponsorship index of every Active mentor.
* Five new Airtable columns on the Sponsors table: Agreement Status, Agreement Accepted On, Agreement Document, Sponsorship interests, Dashboard account.

= 1.92.0 =
* **The Administrator Dashboard.** A page for program managers at /administrator-dashboard/, gated to the administrator level, built like the other dashboards. It shows every queue with its count and its decisions: institution applications with the six decisions, Collaboration Agreements awaiting review with the reviewer's checklist, download, accept and return (and the returned and revoked ones, with Reinstate), semester reports to review, semesters due for drafting with Draft now, and approved reports this semester, open mentor requests with handle and decline, the programs running as a totals strip per track and one row per institution with students in progress, and the syncs' health with locked accounts, the private storage probe, the last mail and the invitation run. A strip of eight counts at the top links to the cards. Decisions made on the page come back to it; Draft now opens the new draft where the manager reads it, and a refused Draft now comes back; the wp-admin screens stay for settings, syncs and the rarer work.
* The Updates column and the guide button know the administrator audience; the toolbar's Dashboards menu lists the page for managers.
* Collaboration Agreements and mentor requests can be listed by state from code (`in_state()`, `closed_requests()`), and the decision forms carry the double-submit guard everywhere they are drawn.

= 1.91.2 =
* **A vetted person's account is created even when the host's signup spam check would refuse the address.** On WordPress.com every new account passes through the platform's bkismet signup check, which answers "block" for some addresses, and WordPress reported that as "Not enough data to create this user." - so a mentor synced from Airtable on 4 September had no account, the sync notice named no cause, and Add New User in wp-admin failed the same way. Every account this plugin creates was vetted by a person first - a mentor or student from Airtable, an institution account from an approved application, a manager's import or invitation - and none is a self-signup, so all of them are now created through one helper that switches that check off for the length of the insert and no longer. A new test suite reproduces the host's refusal and refuses any account path in the plugin that does not go through the helper.

= 1.91.1 =
* A semester report stays on the Institution Dashboard and the manager's index when a sync re-dates or removes the roster rows it was written from; the card reads the reports themselves rather than the roster.
* The Institutions screen lists every draft, however old, and caps only the approved list at the sixty most recently edited.
* A member following a link to a report that is still being prepared lands on an open card.
* Test suites: the report suite's policy stand-in now refuses a member the edit action, as the real policy does; three assertions that could not fail were replaced.

= 1.91.0 =
* **The semester report is drafted by the site and approved by a program manager; the institution reads it.** A daily job drafts a report for every institution semester that has ended (after a grace of 45 days when students are still in progress, and never for a semester that ended before this release was installed), and tells the program managers. A manager can also press Draft now on the Institutions screen for any institution and semester. Managers edit the report on the Institution Dashboard as before and press Approve; only then does the institution see it, as a read-only document with a Download PDF button, and its accounts are mailed. Reopening takes it back to a draft and out of the institution's view. Institutions can no longer generate or edit reports (design of 4 September 2026).
* The two states are draft and approved. Reports marked final by the earlier flow read as approved after the upgrade, approved by nobody in particular. Approval is refused while the students' consent answers cannot be read, because a report that cannot be drawn in full must not be published.
* The Institutions screen's Semester reports card lists drafts first, says whether the site or a manager drafted each report, lists the semesters due for drafting with a Draft now button each, and keeps a log of drafts, approvals and reopenings.
* Three settings: whether the job runs, the grace, and who hears of a draft (empty means every program manager).

= 1.90.0 =
* **Every finding of the 3 September deep check is fixed, each with a test that fails without the fix.** Forty-one findings across seven review lenses, independently refuted before they were accepted; the release is those fixes and nothing else. The high and the eight mediums first.
* **Author archives no longer name the program's people.** WordPress answered `?author=N` with a 200 and the account's display name for every existing account, and for anyone who had authored a published record of any type it redirected to `/author/<login>/` as well. The syncs set display names to real names, and the plugin stored calls, notes and audit rows as published with the person as author, so a logged-out visitor could walk the IDs and read the program's students, mentors and university staff. Author archives are now a 404 for anyone without the manage capability, sent before the redirect can fire; the users sitemap is gone and the users REST route is refused to the same people (a signed-in person may still read their own record); and calls, notes and audit rows are private posts, with the rows written before this release flipped once on upgrade. Real content (the dashboard pages, the Updates posts) is untouched.
* **Gated posts no longer appear in listings, feeds and search to people who may not read them.** The content-access filter returned early on any query with no post type set, which is the main query on the blog index, the Updates category, every feed and front-end search; the welcome post gated to institutions was on a logged-out search page. An unset post type is gated now, and the two feed hooks that never passed through the content filter are taken as well.
* **A plus sign in a student's address reaches Airtable as itself.** The formula went into the request URL unencoded and the HTTP layer left `+`, `&` and `=` alone, so `anna+wp@example.org` reached Airtable as `anna wp@example.org` and matched nobody: the roster refused a real student, the semester report withheld them, the import could create a duplicate, all without a word. Every value in an Airtable request URL is percent-encoded now.
* **A running sync no longer overwrites what a school or a manager did during it.** The roster index used to be rewritten wholesale at the end of every run from rows read at its start, so a graduate press, an edit or an imported student landing in between vanished until the next run three hours later, and the roster claimed to be fresher than before. Rows written on this site now carry the time of the write, and the run keeps any row touched since it read the table.
* **An account follows the report record that governs it, not the first one that arrived.** Twenty-three students have two Students Reports rows for one address. The account was bound forever to whichever row Airtable returned first, so a re-enrolled student whose old row said Dropped out stayed inactive with no mentor while the active row was reported as a conflict on every run. When the stamped row is past, or is no longer among the tracked records, and another row for the address is active, the account follows the active row; two active rows prefer the most recently created; every move is written into the run report.
* **A newly approved institution can act on its own imported students at once.** Inserting a student into a roster the last sync wrote no counts for left the row visible but unplaceable, so edits and status changes were refused until the next sync. An insert registers the institution in the counts, and the policy opens the caller's own roster first.
* **Two presses of Upload file one agreement.** The Institution Dashboard never loaded the script behind the double-submit guard its forms carry, and the upload handler had no lock between reading "nothing in review" and inserting. The dashboard loads the guard now, and the upload holds the institution's lock across the read and the insert, releasing it on every exit.
* **The Student Report Card an institution reads leaves out what is between the student and the program.** For a Developer Track student the read-only card included the personal alumni address, the post-program plans and the mentoring opt-in. The card knows who is reading: a manager and the student's own mentor see all of it, an institution sees none of those three and no field of type email.
* **A blank status setting no longer makes a sync read the whole table.** An empty list turned into no filter, so a manager saving the settings screen with a status box blank would have provisioned every SPAM and rejected row, or revoked every current student. The three fields that must never be blank go back to their defaults on save, the screen says so, and both syncs refuse to start on an empty list.
* The five Institutions cron jobs (application retention, agreement discard and reminders, invitation expiry, the ceiling sweep) and the call reminders are put on the clock on every load, not only at activation, which never fires on this site's deploy path. They happened to be scheduled here; a site that lost them would never have got them back.
* Uploading an agreement refuses an unresolved institution before the nonce, as generating one already did, so a manager with no switcher value cannot file a document under an empty record. The public application form reads X-Forwarded-For from the edge's end, not the client's, so an applicant cannot pick their own limiter bucket. The roster's "Not yet in the Students table" list and search no longer show or match students' addresses to institution members. The student card no longer falls back to a Gravatar URL built from the student's address. Institution members are told a read failed in a fixed sentence rather than shown Airtable's own error text.
* Uninstall now removes invitation and request posts, mails the site owner an inventory of the signed agreements it deliberately keeps (they are the program's legal records) and writes that inventory beside the files only when the host blocks the directory. The import lock is a heartbeat with a token, so a slow slice is not mistaken for a dead one and a slice that lost its lock does not release the newcomer's. A 404 or 413 from Airtable halts an import recoverably instead of failing every row. The semester report caches only what it may use, so an unreleased quote is held nowhere on this site. Every folded panel's title is a heading, which heading navigation reaches. The ceiling counts a claim of several places as one row first, so two concurrent first claims are told the truth. A request argument that is an array reads as 0, as the docblock promised. The mail log keeps a masked address and the template's name, never the subject.
* Twenty refused cheap claims a day lock an institution account out of roster changes for the rest of the day, as design spec 5.3 always said and the code never did; the lock writes one audit row and the Institutions screen lists the accounts locked today.
* The code that owns the Airtable record-ID check is the Airtable client; the Mentors sync keeps an alias for one release. The three modules that own a sync share one base class for their three handlers, the capability check, the redirect and one wording for the shared outcomes, all travelling by a per-user flash rather than a query argument. The student edit handler is four steps a suite can drive, and the branch that fires when the audit row will not insert is finally executed by one. The suites share one capability stand-in that reads the capability it is asked for, so a handler checking the wrong one fails. The "decides before Airtable" scan follows one call. Forty-four `phpcs:ignore` annotations that suppressed nothing are gone, and `bin/check-standards.sh --dead` finds the next one. Every em and en dash in the plugin is a hyphen, and the standards check fails on a new one. Two look-alike action names are told apart (`wpcpm_semester_report_save`, `wpcpm_student_report_save`), every option constant is spelled `OPT_`, and the administrators' guide lists every option the plugin keeps. The installable zip is built from `.distignore` and carries no development files.

= 1.89.0 =
* **Phase 6 of the Institutions module: the semester report.** An institution can generate a report about the students it sent in one semester, edit its narrative on the dashboard, and print it. Eight sections: an overview, participation from the roster index with the previous semester beside it, the contribution teams across the cohort, the students' projects and blogs, recognition and events, continuing engagement, student feedback, and looking ahead. The report is a snapshot document: it is generated on request, it carries the date the roster was read, and it holds nothing the school could not print. No email address, no status beside a name, no hours, no grade, no accessibility disclosure, no rating, no mentor's name.
* **A student appears in it only if they said so, and is quoted only if they said so.** Two questions join the Permissions box of the Finishing-up form: whether the institution may list the student in its semester report (by name, by blog address only, or not), and whether it may quote their feedback (with their name, without it, or not). Only the student can answer them: a program manager saving that form on a student's behalf has those two answers dropped, and is told so. A school never sees a quote before its author released it. The answers are checked again on every render, on screen and in print alike, so a student who changes their mind disappears from a report that was generated weeks ago without anybody regenerating it, and the screen says a withdrawal happened; the printed sheet does not, because on paper that sentence would be about the student.
* **The quotes are the students' answers to "One example of a contribution you are proud of."** That is the column every quote in the reference report came from; the column whose label asks about sharing a quote publicly has never been filled in on any of the 834 feedback rows and is not read.
* The report is edited where the roster is, never in wp-admin: one form, each section a card with the generated part read-only above the school's own paragraph, a hide toggle, and a picker for the released quotes with an English translation box and a show-the-name tick that exists only where the student allowed their name. Two colleagues share one institution, so a save made from a page opened before somebody else's save is refused and the text kept, not lost. Revisions can be restored. A report can be marked final and reopened.
* Printing is a plain document with the plugin's own stylesheet and no theme part, opened through a link that asks the browser to print. Every link on it shows its address as text, so a photocopy still leads somewhere.
* **Asking students who have written something but not said whether it may be used is a program manager's act, not the institution's.** The button sits on the Institutions screen in wp-admin, writes to at most twenty-five students a press with the rest queued, and never to the same student twice inside thirty days. The institution's own screen shows how many students are withheld and why, and says a program manager can send the request. The student guide names this exception to its promise that the institution never sees the feedback forms: it sees exactly what the student released, and nothing else.
* The Institutions screen lists every semester report with its institution, semester, state and dates, opened through the switcher.
* **Every panel on the Institution Dashboard folds.** Current and Waiting for a mentor, Institution representatives and the Collaboration Agreement were plain headings beside three panels that folded; they are disclosures now, drawn open, with the same chevron. Finished and Did not start still start closed, and a long group starts closed whichever it is.
* Fixes to the report before it shipped, each with a test that fails without it: a student's remembered feedback row is resolved again when the site learns which institution they belong to, so a withdrawal typed by a student lands on the row their school's report reads rather than on a duplicate linked elsewhere; a website address carrying a user name, which is how an email address typed into the website box arrives, is dropped whole rather than printed under the heading of the one path meant not to name the student; a save made while the students' answers could not be read, or after a colleague refreshed them, keeps the quotes and translations the form could not see instead of unticking every one; every handler answers a report that is not the reader's exactly as it answers one that does not exist, so nobody can count another school's reports by trying numbers; a report whose roster index has gone reads as "the answers could not be checked" rather than as every student having withdrawn; a student with no program record is no longer counted as one whose records could not be matched, and that count is its own sentence rather than an item in the list of students not shown; a lead who never enrolled is neither listed nor counted, so the report and the roster's participation numbers agree; a semester holding only a spam row is a semester with no students rather than one with zero; the same WordCamp typed with a capital letter is one event; and uninstall removes a trashed report as well as the live ones.

= 1.88.1 =
* A list pasted into the enrollment form is read with its lines intact. It was read through the sanitiser that collapses whitespace, so a pasted CSV arrived as a single line: the header ran into the first student's name and the file was refused for having no email column. Every test had fed the parser a string directly and none had come through a posted form, so nothing caught it until a real import did.

= 1.88.0 =
* A school's uploaded list of students is no longer kept forever. Each import batch holds names and email addresses, and nothing removed one: a check run once left those names on the site indefinitely. A finished batch is now kept for thirty days and one nobody confirmed for seven, on the same daily job the application retention runs on. A batch still being created is never swept, however old, because rows of it may be in flight.
* Uninstalling removes them too, with the check log and any lock a dead request left behind. Before this the plugin could be deleted and every list would stay in the database. The students an import created are untouched: they are records and accounts, which is the line uninstall draws everywhere else.
* The two windows are fixed rather than settings. The application retention is configurable because a program may want to keep a rejected application for a year; nobody wants a longer copy of a working list, and a setting would only be a way to switch a data-protection rule off by accident.

= 1.87.0 =
* Phase 5 of the Institutions module is complete. An institution can now send a list of students, see what it was understood to say, and confirm it; the records are created a slice at a time, and an import that runs long carries on by itself.
* Creating is written to survive being interrupted. A row's state is saved before the request and not after, so a row whose answer was lost is identifiable afterward and is searched for by its `Site import key` before anything is created again: a killed request costs a retry, never a second student. Records are created one call at a time, because a batch call returns a re-indexed list and would stamp the wrong record on the wrong person after the first refusal.
* A refusal that is not the row's own no longer writes off the batch. A missing token, an open rate-limit window or a 500 refuses every call that follows, and marking each row failed in turn would have ended a three hundred row import with three hundred students terminally failed. The slice stops and is rescheduled; rows that were never sent go back to pending, and a row whose answer may have been lost stays recoverable.
* The guard runs before every slice and reads the member who confirmed rather than whoever is present, so a revoke or an unsettled agreement stops an import that is continuing on cron with nobody signed in.
* A student's logged hours are on the roster and in both exports, reading "12 of 150" against a track with a target and "12 h" against one without, never "12 of 0". Fractional hours are kept: the base holds 6.2 and 135.5 for real students.

= 1.86.4 =
* The enrollment section's chevron matches the roster's, and the open form is the bordered panel the theme hangs off an open row, which is what says the section is open. The section had its own left padding to line the form up by hand; the theme zeroes that padding at a higher specificity, so it never applied and the alignment came from the theme all along. Handed back rather than left as a rule that looks load-bearing and is not.

= 1.86.3 =
* The consent tick is beside its own words again. Every input on the dashboard is given a full width, and a checkbox obeying that became a control the width of the page with the tick drawn in the middle of it and its label pushed into a narrow column at the far right.
* The enrollment form lines up with the row that opens it. The shared group summary carries its own inset, so the form beneath it sat 32px to the left of the heading it belongs to.
* The row now shows whether the section is open: it was missing the class the shared disclosure hangs its open state on, so the chevron never turned.
* Tutor is a picker whether or not the base has any for that institution. A free-text box invites a name matching nothing in the Tutors table, which is how that column filled with spellings; an institution with none recorded now gets an empty picker and a sentence saying who to ask.

= 1.86.2 =
* The enrollment form no longer mentions a WordPress.org profile anywhere. The confirmation a school gives now reads "These students have been notified that their name and email address are shared with the WordPress Foundation for the WordPress Credits Program", which is what is actually shared at that point: a profile is not, because the student does not have one until after they are enrolled. The file hint stopped listing it as a column too.
* "Told" is "notified" throughout that form, in the confirmation, in the refusal when it is not ticked, and in the field the two are recorded under.

= 1.86.1 =
* The tutor picker finds its tutors. 1.86.0 asked Airtable for them with a formula, and a formula reading a linked-record column sees the linked rows' name rather than their record ID, so matching on the ID found nothing for every institution and every picker was empty. The whole table is fourteen rows across the program, so it is read once and filtered here, where the record IDs are what the data actually holds.

= 1.86.0 =
* The enrollment section folds, using the same disclosure the roster's own groups use, and opens by itself when a list is waiting or the last attempt left something to say. It is the longest thing on the page and the rarest thing anybody comes for.
* It is styled. Every class it prints now has a rule on this page: the field styling it was relying on lives in the application form's stylesheet, which is not loaded on the dashboard, so labels, boxes and the consent tick came out as the browser's own.
* The form no longer asks for a WordPress.org profile. Getting one is the student's own first step of onboarding, after they are enrolled, so nobody has one to give at the moment a school fills this in. A CSV that happens to carry the column is still read.
* Field of study is a picker of the base's own nine values rather than a text box. It is a single-select in Airtable and records are written without typecast, so a value spelled any other way was a refusal of the whole record.
* Tutor is a picker of this institution's own tutors, read from the Tutors table and cached for half a day. Never the program's whole list: that would tell one school who tutors at another. A school with none recorded gets a text box.

= 1.85.1 =
* The switch that turns enrollment lists on is on the settings screen, under Institutions, beside the applications switch. It had been deliberately left off the form while the import had no screen of its own, which was right until the screen shipped in 1.85.0 and wrong from that moment: the setting existed, defaulted to off, and had nowhere to be turned on. The row names the ceilings, so nobody has to read the source to learn what a school is allowed to send.

= 1.85.0 =
* An institution can send a list of students to be enrolled. Choose the program and the term once, then add one student through five boxes or send a CSV, and the site reads it and shows what it understood before anything is created: which rows are ready, which are already on your roster, which cannot be imported from here, and which could not be read and why. Nothing is created yet; that is the next release, and the screen says so. The whole section is behind a setting that is off by default.
* The file is read and never stored. It is refused rather than converted when it is not UTF-8, because guessing an encoding wrong spells somebody's name wrong on a record that is then created, synced and printed on a certificate. A start date more than a year from today is refused as a typo, since a whole cohort filed under the wrong year is unpicked a record at a time.
* The roster carries a download control, and one student's card carries its own. Both are drawn only for a reader the fence would allow to follow them, and the roster's file matches the cohort on screen.
* An institution can mark a student graduated or withdrawn from that student's card. The control is the last thing on the page, because it is the one thing there that cannot be taken back.

= 1.84.1 =
* A student's personal website appears on the roster whether or not they have signed in here. It was the last column still read only through the student's WordPress account, after the profile, the mentor and the team. The four are now filled from one list in the sync, so a fifth is a line rather than another round of somebody spotting a blank cell.

= 1.84.0 =
* A student's mentor and contribution team appear on an institution's roster whether or not that student has ever signed in here. Both live on the Students Reports row and were read only through the student's WordPress account, so a school saw them for the handful of students who happen to hold an account and nothing for the rest: at one university, two rows of fifteen. The sync has both values in hand when it joins the two tables and now writes them into the roster index. Where a student does hold an account, that copy is still preferred, being the fresher of the two between runs.
* The mentor column no longer tells a school its student is further behind than they are. An empty mentor name has two causes, and the cell named only one of them: it said the report record had not been created yet, while the index was holding that record's ID. It now says which of the two it is.
* The roster index carries two more columns, so a stored copy from before this release is discarded and rebuilt on the next sync rather than rendering half a row.

= 1.83.0 =
* Provisioning no longer adopts an account that belongs to somebody else. An account found by email carrying another module's record stamp, or a role this program did not give it, is a conflict rather than a match: it is counted, named in the run report, and left alone. Without this, an institution importing a mentor's or a colleague's address would have had that person's account turned into a student on their roster at the next sync, opening their Student Report Card to a school they have nothing to do with.
* An institution can mark a student graduated or withdrawn, and nothing else. Pausing and pending graduation are the program's calls. The row is read again and confirmed before the write, and a currently Paused student is refused by name: the mirror automation is restricted to a view that Paused is not in, so marking one Graduate would mail the student while the report record, the account and the mentor's list all stayed Paused.
* Two CSV exports, the roster and one student. Both are written with a byte order mark, because Excel reads a BOM-less UTF-8 file as Latin-1 and mangles every accented name in the program, and any cell beginning `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` is prefixed with an apostrophe so a spreadsheet reads it as text rather than as a formula. Accessibility needs appear in neither: they were disclosed to the program, not to the school.
* A program manager can link an unlinked Students row to an institution from the reconciliation card. It refuses when the row already carries a mentor with a matching status, and when any Students Reports row exists for the address, because writing the link onto such a row fires the Airtable automation and creates a second report record.
* A student's WordPress.org profile appears on institution rosters again. The profile lives on the Students Reports row and the index was reading only the Students table's own column, which at one university is empty for every one of their fifteen students while the report record carries it for eleven of them. The index now falls back to it, and a school that fills its own column keeps what it wrote.

= 1.82.0 =
* The import now checks each row against the two Airtable tables and this site's accounts before anything is created. A student already on the institution's own roster is named in full, with their status and start date, because that is the school's own list. Every other kind of hit gets one answer and one only: this student cannot be imported from here. A preview that said which other university, or whether an account exists, would answer three hundred questions about who is in the program for anyone who could paste three hundred addresses. A program manager is told which it was; the school never is.
* A WordPress.org profile is treated as an identity alongside the address, so a student enrolled elsewhere under a different mailbox is still found. The base holds profiles as URLs and the file holds handles, so the query is a substring search and every candidate it returns is then normalised and compared exactly in PHP: a URL written three ways still matches, and `ann` inside `joanna` does not.
* A name already on the institution's own roster is a warning rather than a refusal. Two people at one university do share a name.

= 1.81.0 =
* The reading half of the institutions import. `WPCPM_Institution_Import` takes the text of a CSV, or one student's row, and returns cleaned rows with a verdict each. It opens no socket, writes no post and creates nothing: the staging, the checks against the base and the creation loop are separate pieces still to come, and a test asserts this file reaches none of them.
* A file is read the way registries actually export one: a byte order mark stripped, semicolons and tabs read as well as commas, quoted newlines kept whole, and headers matched by spelling, so `Full Name`, `E-Mail` and `full_name` all land. An unknown column is listed back rather than refusing the file. A file that is not UTF-8 is refused rather than converted, because guessing an encoding wrong writes a mangled name onto a record that is then created, synced and printed.
* A name beginning `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` refuses the row: it is a formula to every spreadsheet a program manager opens the export in, and it reaches the subject line of the welcome automation. A mandatory field that fails refuses the row; an optional one is dropped and named, so a mistyped field of study costs a school a column and not a student. Two rows describing one person block each other, naming the line.

= 1.80.2 =
* A program track is no longer required to count hours. 1.80.0 asserted that every track had a row in the hours map, which would have made hours a condition of adding a track at all: the next track that does not count them would have failed a test rather than simply showing no denominator. A track absent from the map now has no target, the same answer the Developer Track's explicit zero gives, and that is pinned as the supported state.

= 1.80.1 =
* An institution whose home page has a very long head no longer reports having no site icon. The resolver read at most 200KB, and one university in the program does not close its head until byte 309,827, so its icon declarations were past the cut. The answer was wrong rather than failed, and cached for a week. The read now covers any real head, and only the head is searched, which keeps it cheap and keeps a link tag in the page body from being mistaken for the site's icon.

= 1.80.0 =
* Phase 5 of the Institutions module begins with hours. `WPCPM_Program::hours_target()` and `has_hours_target()` say what each track is worked towards: 150 hours, 50 hours, and none at all for the Developer Track, which is worked to merged contributions rather than to a clock. The Students Reports `Hours` column now travels through both syncs and the report form, so a student's logged hours reach the mentor's card and the institution's roster.
* Every Students Reports column the syncs read is now checked against the table's field list, not just the columns the report form writes. A renamed column used to fail silently: Airtable answers with the field simply absent, so it reads empty for every student and nothing reports a problem.

= 1.79.0 =
* The contact an institution's record names is now listed under Institution representatives, whether or not they hold an account on this site. The card counted accounts alone, so forty of the forty-two confirmed institutions read "Institution representatives 0" three lines under a header naming that very person. The row says the account is what is missing, and it disappears by itself once one exists. The Institutions screen counts and lists the same way, so the heading means one thing on both.

= 1.78.4 =
* The panels on the Institution Dashboard now sit evenly inside their own borders. A heading does not collapse its top margin through a panel's padding, so the cohort strip and the agreement card carried 45px and 53px above their first line against 21px below it. The inset is now the padding on both sides.

= 1.78.3 =
* An institution's icon that this site can reach but the reader cannot now takes itself off the page instead of leaving a broken-image glyph beside the name. A university's server answering this site quickly says nothing about whether it answers a program manager on another continent.

= 1.78.2 =
* The cohort summary and the agreement panel have the same room inside them. They are the two bordered blocks a school sees on the page, and one being tighter than the other made it read as a different kind of thing.

= 1.78.1 =
* An institution whose site serves its logo from a CDN gets its icon again. The declaration is still skipped, because a page the program does not own must not be able to point a dashboard at a third party, but the lookup now goes on to the site's own conventional icon instead of giving up at the first candidate.

= 1.78.0 =
* **A long group of students starts closed, whichever group it is.** One institution has forty-two students on the program at once, and an open list of forty-two buried everything under it: the other groups, the people, the agreement. Past twelve the group opens on its count with one press to see inside; below that it stays open, because a short list that has to be opened has been hidden for no reason. The students are all still on the page, so the browser's own find still reaches them.

= 1.77.2 =
* The facts under an institution's name lose their full stops. They are labeled values on their own lines now rather than a sentence, and a trailing point on "Stage: Confirmed" reads as a typo rather than as grammar.

= 1.77.1 =
* The institution's header reads a fact to a line: the name, where it is, its website, the stage the program has it at, and who the program writes to. They used to run together in one sentence.
* The site icon sits beside that whole block rather than against the first line of it, which is the arrangement the Mentor Report Card uses for a mentor's photo.

= 1.77.0 =
* **The institution's own site icon sits beside its name**, which is the nearest thing an institution has to the profile photo a mentor and a student are shown. Read from the institution's own website and never through a third-party icon service, which would be told which institution every program manager looked at and when. A site that declares none, or answers with a sign-in page where an icon should be, shows nothing rather than a broken image, and both answers are cached for a week.
* **"People with access" is now "Institution representatives."**

= 1.76.1 =
* The line under the consent box reads "You can read the privacy policy here", with the link on the word rather than trailing a colon. The tags are passed to the sentence as arguments, so a translation can put the linked word where its own grammar wants it.

= 1.76.0 =
* **The Institutions module has its own settings section.** The application form was a single row at the foot of the Students card, under a heading that said Students module, which is where nobody would look for it.
* **Five institution settings gained a control**, having existed since Phase 0 with none, so the only way to change any of them was in code: the institution landing page, whether the nightly sync creates the first account for a Confirmed institution, what happens to an institution's people when it leaves the pipeline, how long a signed agreement may wait before the queue calls it overdue, who is told when one arrives, and where the agreement wording lives.

= 1.75.1 =
* **The announcements and the Resources section move to the top of the Institution Dashboard**, under the institution's name. The two Report Cards end on that section, which is right for them: a mentor comes to work through a list. A school arrives with a question more often than with a task, and the answer was three screens down past a roster it had not come to read.

= 1.75.0 =
* **Institutions module, Phase 4: an institution can change things, not just read them.** A student's name, dates and field of study are editable through an allowlist: a column outside it has no control, is never read from the request and cannot be written, and every save writes one audit row naming who changed what, from what, to what, and on what ground.
* **Institutions can keep their own notes on their own students.** A mentor never sees them and they never see a mentor's; a note written before this release keeps exactly the audience it had.
* **Members can invite their colleagues.** The invitation token is stored hashed and never in the clear, the link lands on a page that asks before anything happens, and every failure gives one message, because "this expired" and "no such invitation" together would tell a stranger which addresses were invited. A revoked agreement cancels the pending invitations and the acceptance asks the gate again for itself.
* **A member can ask for a mentor** for a student who has none, once per student, and a program manager resolves it.
* **An accepted agreement can be revoked and reinstated.** Revoking writes Airtable first, deletes the site's record of the agreement so the account is limited from that request rather than after the next sync, leaves the pipeline stage alone, and emails everybody at the institution the reason.
* **The plugin's copy of the Collaboration Agreement can be checked against the Doc** from a button on the Institutions screen. A button only: the Doc is world-editable, so a scheduled check could be told what to say by anybody.
* **Three post types had names longer than WordPress allows and were never registered.** `wpcpm_institution_app` had been in that state since 1.73.0, which meant the application form's storage had no capability mapping at all. All are renamed, nothing was lost because no rows existed, and a test now measures every post type the plugin declares.

= 1.74.0 =
* **The Institution Dashboard ends on a Resources section**, the same one the Student and Mentor Report Cards end on: the program's announcements at that access level, the handbook page written for institutions, the WordPress Credits Slack channel, and the "Need help?" assistant.
* **It names the institution's own contact at the program.** Every institution is routed to a program manager by country, and until now that name appeared only in the panel of a revoked agreement, which is the worst possible moment to meet it for the first time. Their address is there, and a booking link where the program has one. A country the program has not routed yet shows nothing rather than an empty heading.
* Drawn for a locked account as well, deliberately: an institution that cannot see its students yet is the one most likely to need somebody to ask.

= 1.73.4 =
* The first person in the People card has its top border back. An older rule was still stripping it from the first row, left over from when the members were a hairline-separated list rather than cards, and it outranked the rule that draws the card.

= 1.73.3 =
* **A collapsed group now looks like something you press.** Finished and Did not start were headings with a chevron pushed to the far side of the page, and nothing under the cursor changed; they are bordered rows that lift on hover, joining the panel they open. The Mentor Report Card gains the same, because it draws the same component.
* **Each person with access is a card**, so who they are and how they got there stands out from the paragraph explaining the card, rather than reading as one more line of it.
* A student's closed card shows their mentor's name. It was showing the Mentor column's full sentence about whether a mentor had been assigned, which under eight names in a row is noise.

= 1.73.2 =
* **The roster is no longer a table that scrolls sideways.** Each student is a card that opens, which is the component the Mentor Report Card already uses for the same job: the name, the program badge and the dates and mentor on the closed row, everything else inside. Nothing on the page scrolls horizontally at any width, and the cards need no separate mobile layout because they were built for one.
* **The cohort summary reads as a notice** rather than as more body text, in the same tinted shape the page already uses for one.
* The cards are drawn with the Mentor Report Card's own classes, so the two pages share one stylesheet and cannot drift apart.

= 1.73.1 =
* **The Institution Dashboard now reads like the Student and Mentor Report Cards.** Its sections are separated by space and a rule rather than boxed one inside another, and only the agreement panel keeps a border, because it is the one place a school is asked to do something.
* **The filter bar was stacking every control down the page.** All three fields shared one wrapper, while the stylesheet lays a field out as its label above its control, so it stacked label, control, label, control. Each field has its own wrapper now and the bar is one row that wraps.
* **The roster is readable.** Dates no longer break across five lines, the head reads as a head, and the columns that must not wrap are named by the plugin's own column keys rather than by their headings, which are translated.
* **On a phone the roster becomes one card per student**, each cell carrying its own label, which is the shape a mentor already reads on the same screen. The markup was prepared for this and the stylesheet had never used it.
* The People card lists a person per row with the control at the end, and a switcher's select no longer runs off the side of a narrow screen, on any dashboard.

= 1.73.0 =
* **Institutions module, Phase 3: institutions can apply, and agreements can be signed through the site.** A public application form with thirteen questions, a consent gate that stores the wording and the policy's own modified date rather than a tick, a honeypot, a dwell token, per-source and site-wide limits, content scoring that holds a submission for a person rather than refusing it, and duplicate flagging that never merges two submissions. Off by default: switch it on under Settings, and note that it shows nothing to the public until the site has a published privacy policy.
* **A review queue on the Institutions screen**, one list of applications and signed agreements waiting, oldest first, with an overdue mark, the country's contact for information, and a count on the menu. Six decisions: approve, ask for more information, reject, reject as spam, reopen, purge. A rejection is a neutral acknowledgement with no reason; a spam row is told nothing at all.
* **Approving creates the Airtable record, the pipeline row, the account and the invitation**, in that order, each half stamped as it lands so an interrupted approval is finished by pressing Approve again rather than by starting over. An address that already has an account is a conflict and is named, never adopted.
* **The agreement path**: generate the program's template as a print document the institution saves as a PDF, upload a signed copy, download it, accept it, return it with a note, or withdraw it. Uploads are checked as PDFs rather than trusted by name, refused if encrypted or carrying a launch action, and stored encrypted with an unguessable name; nothing that fails a check reaches the store. Every step emails every member of the institution, and a nightly digest tells program managers what is still waiting.
* **Agreement files for withdrawn and returned documents are forgotten on a schedule**, and applications are purged by three retention settings.

= 1.72.1 =
* **A newly created dashboard page is gated as intended.** The access level is registered with a default of public, which is what WordPress answers for a page that has no access row at all, so "gate it unless it is already set" read a brand-new page as deliberately public and left it open. Found on the live site with the new Institution Dashboard; the same line was in the Mentor and Student dashboards and is fixed in all three. Existing pages already gated are untouched.

= 1.72.0 =
* **Institutions module, Phase 2: an institution can log in.** A new Institution Dashboard page, gated to institution accounts, with the students the pipeline index holds for that institution in four groups (current, waiting for a mentor, finished, did not start), a cohort picker with a comparison against the previous cohort, a filter bar whose state lives in the URL, a read-only card for one student including their Student Report Card, and a People card listing who has access with Remove and Leave. Program managers see every institution through a switcher and a banner naming any unsettled agreement.
* **The agreement gate is real.** An institution whose Collaboration Agreement is not recorded sees only the agreement panel, and the policy refuses its roster, its students and the report route whatever the page hides. Every render and every handler asks the policy first; the one fence in front of live Airtable reads, claim(), now hands over only the columns the roster publishes, so the accessibility disclosure and the program's notes cannot reach a school through it.
* **Accounts are created from the Contact Email**, for a Confirmed institution with a recorded agreement and no membership history, live or former; an address that already has any account is a conflict and is named rather than adopted. Per-institution and bulk controls, both gated on the agreement.
* **Agreements signed before this site existed can be recorded as on file**, one at a time with a Drive link, or all at once: every Confirmed institution with nothing recorded, with the one link they share. Each gets its own recorded agreement, its own audit row and its own Airtable cells, written base-first and refused outright if the base refuses.
* Managers can add an account for an institution by hand, re-add a former member in one click, and are told, rather than silenced, when they press Remove on a membership that has already ended.
* The institution identity header reads the pipeline index rather than the stamp taken when the account was attached, so it no longer freezes at that day.

= 1.71.0 =
* **The address of the Collaboration Agreement wording is now a setting rather than a value in the code.** The document it was copied from is editable by anyone holding its link, and this plugin's source is public, so carrying the link in the code handed out write access to the wording institutions sign. The template says in words where it came from; a site that needs the address is given it in Settings, where it is held to https and to Google's own hosts.

= 1.70.1 =
* Translation template regenerated: 1,146 strings, against 1.70.0's behavior. It had not been rebuilt since 19 August, so everything added since then was untranslatable.
* Coding standards: the tree now reports no errors at all.

= 1.70.0 =
* **A group session can be changed, not only canceled.** Moving one used to mean canceling on everybody and asking them to join again. The mentor can now change the time, the length, the places and what it is about, from the session itself.
* **Everybody on a moved session is emailed a new invitation that replaces the one in their calendar**, and only when the time actually changed. The invitation counts up each time it is sent, which is what makes a calendar move the entry it already holds instead of adding a second one beside it.
* Places cannot be set below the number of students already on the session, and the form will not let a mentor try. A session no longer clashes with itself when it is saved without being moved.

= 1.69.0 =
* **Signing in can now ask for a code as well as a password.** The codes, the login step and the rate limiting come from the Two Factor plugin, which WordPress.org publishes and which runs entirely on this site. Nothing is sent to any other service and no account anywhere else is involved.
* **Program managers and institution accounts are asked for one from their next sign-in, with nothing to set up first**, because the code is emailed. That matters more than it sounds: the alternative, letting people in on a password and then asking them to set up an app, leaves a gap in which somebody holding a stolen password sets up their own.
* Everyone can then set up an authenticator app on their profile screen, which is quicker and does not depend on email. The Mentor and Student Report Cards now say so, because the plugin puts its controls in an admin screen that mentors and students never open.
* Mentors and students are not required to use it, and can turn it on for themselves. Which roles must use it is a setting, so widening it later does not need a release.
* Settings gains a card showing the policy and how far along each role is.

= 1.68.0 =
* **Signed agreements are protected without asking the host for anything.** This site's host hands out any file under the uploads directory to whoever knows its name, and will not add a rule to stop. So the store now does two things for itself: the folder's name begins with a dot, which the host's own rules already refuse, and every file is encrypted before it is written, so what a misconfigured host would hand over is unreadable. The storage card says which of the two is doing the work, measured rather than assumed, and would notice the day the host changed.
* A file altered after it was stored is refused rather than shown to a reviewer as the document that was signed, and the store accepts one kind of file, a PDF.
* Nothing had been uploaded yet, so nothing needed converting; a site that did have files in the old folder has them moved on the next load.

= 1.67.0 =
* **The Institutions screen is real.** It reads the site's own copy of the base and never Airtable: a sync panel, the pipeline grouped by stage with an agreement column and a "Confirmed with no agreement recorded" filter, the reconciliation card, the consent report, the agreement template card and a storage probe. Nothing institutions themselves can see yet; that is the next release.
* A daily **institutions sync** reads the Institutions and Countries tables into an index, rebuilds each institution's agreement state, and closes the gate on any institution that has left the active stages. It runs four hours off the students sync, which recurs every three, so the two never share a slot.
* **A student's institution is now a record ID, not a name.** The students sync reads it from the Students table by the email join and stamps the account; a name that failed to resolve used to match every other unresolved name. The sync also writes a per-institution roster index and the reconciliation counts behind the manager card.
* **`WPCPM_Institution_Policy` is the one fence.** Every institution-side path asks it and acts on what it returns; the map of who may do what is explicit, an unknown action is refused rather than allowed, and "not yours", "no such record" and "agreement outstanding" are one message, so a form cannot be walked to learn which records exist.
* **Membership is a stamp on the person**, written only by `WPCPM_Institution_Members`, with an audit row for every attach and detach and a notice to the program when an institution's last member leaves.
* **The Collaboration Agreement gate reads two sources and fails closed.** It is settled only when the site's accepted document and Airtable's `Agreement Status` agree; typing `On file` with a Drive link into the grid settles it and materialises the record on the site, and typing `Revoked` locks it again on the next sync.
* `WPCPM_Cohort` derives a semester from a start date, reading the date as text so a student who started on 1 July is never filed under June, and its participation counts always sum to the number who signed up.
* Notices addressed to institutions now reach current members rather than every account that once held the role, and `uninstall.php` no longer misses a module class, which would have stopped cleanup halfway.

= 1.66.0 =
* Groundwork for the Institutions module; nothing new on screen yet. The settings the module will read (institutions, applications, agreements, imports) exist with their defaults, and `WPCPM_Settings::maybe_upgrade()` adds **Paused** and **Pending graduation** to a saved status list once. Both syncs build their Airtable formula from that list, so until it held the two statuses no paused student was fetched while every line of code looked correct.
* `WPCPM_Airtable::request()` paces requests to five a second and honours a 429. The wait Airtable asks for is recorded in one option so every process on the site stays away; a cron or WP-CLI run sleeps out a wait of five seconds or less, and a page render gets a `wpcpm_airtable_rate_limited` error at once rather than a hung tab. `formula_in()` takes a third argument that matches through Airtable's own `LOWER()`, for email addresses only.
* `WPCPM_Mail::send_to()` mails an address that has no account yet, in a chosen locale, through the same log; the `wpcpm_mail` filter's third argument is now `WP_User|null`. The invitation gains an institution branch with two wordings: the Collaboration Agreement as the first step, or the account is open because the agreement is on file. Institutions carry their own `wpcpm_institution_invited` stamp, and the sample-invitation card on Settings can send the institution one.
* `WPCPM_Field_Value` holds the one set of cleaning rules the Student Report Card and the feedback forms used to keep separately. Both forms behave as before.
* The Collaboration Agreement template (English, from the Foundation's Doc as modified on 4 November 2025) as a block list, with `WPCPM_Agreement_Template` and a fixture that pins its text so an edit without a version bump fails the suite.
* The submit guard moves out of `calendar.js` into its own `forms.js`, the progress script drives more than one panel on a page, and modules gain `menu_label()` so a screen can carry a count bubble in the menu.
* Fixtures for the Students, Feedback and Institutions tables as read from the base on 2 September 2026, including the eleven fields the module adds, and a suite that checks the settings defaults against the base's own choices.

= 1.65.0 =
* The Students screen shows each student's institution and can be narrowed to one of them.
* **The bulk invitation obeys that filter.** With a cohort selected the button says how many it will reach and names the institution, and the send is narrowed again on the way through - the form posts to `admin-post.php`, which never sees the screen's query string, so a handler reading the filter from the URL would have emailed every student while the screen showed one institution.

= 1.64.4 =
* On the Developer Track the meetings and discussions question moves into the **Alumni Program** section and heads it, which is where that course asks it. The other two tracks keep asking it with the project questions - it is one Airtable column, so it is moved rather than copied.
* The rule now falls above the contribution team, where the next lesson starts, instead of above the section's first heading where it divided nothing.

= 1.64.3 =
* Names the Developer Track's two new runs of questions after the lessons they answer: **Practical**, with the patch-testing question under it, and **Alumni Program**. Patch testing takes a full-width row at the head of the project section, because a section heading closes the two-column pair it would otherwise sit in.

= 1.64.2 =
* Puts two Developer Track questions where the Learn course asks them. Patch testing is lesson 3 and moves out of the course grades into the project section; the alumni program is lesson 7 and moves ahead of the first-contribution reflection at lesson 9, rather than after it. The Airtable view lists columns in table order, which is not the order a student works through.

= 1.64.1 =
* More air between one question and the next on the report form. A field's gray hint sat 3px under the answer it describes and 8px above the next question's title, so it read as belonging to whichever one you looked at first. It is 6px and 28px now, and the vertical rhythm is set in `rem` so the three containers that lay out fields actually agree - in `em` they resolved differently and did not.

= 1.64.0 =
* The Mentor Report Card's triage, counts and search now live in the plugin. They were in wpcredits-theme, which meant a theme change would have taken them with it - the one piece of the card a theme was carrying that was function rather than decoration.
* Ships a baseline stylesheet for them, so they are legible and usable under any theme. A theme's own richer skin still overrides it.
* Which mentor's list is being grouped now comes from the plugin's own `current_mentor()` rather than being worked out a second time, which is what once made an administrator who also mentors see rows with no end dates or note counts.
* The `wpcredits_ending_soon_days` and `wpcredits_stale_note_days` filters are now `wpcpm_ending_soon_days` and `wpcpm_stale_note_days`.

= 1.63.3 =
* Fixes password and invitation links landing on "That page could not be found". On a WordPress.com host with Jetpack SSO switched off, logged-out login requests are redirected to a support-session detection page that is only served under narrow conditions - so a reset link re-opened from a mailbox, the back button, or a pasted message 404s. The password screens now opt out of that detection, which repairs the links already in people's inboxes as well as the ones sent from now on.

= 1.63.2 =
* Lines the consent checkbox up with the left edge every other field in the group shares. The inset was the browser's own margin on a checkbox.

= 1.63.1 =
* Fixes the Developer Track's Project section, which rendered as a run of half-width boxes with an empty column beside them. The second project summary had been inserted into the middle of the team/project pair, which closed the pair early and made the questions after it open a second one.
* The alumni consent checkbox now sits under the address it goes with rather than beside it, and the address takes a full row like every other single-value field.
* Tests now assert that fields sharing a row stay contiguous, and that every control the group lays out itself has a width rule - the two properties whose absence let the section come out scattered.

= 1.63.0 =
* Moves the Developer Track's three end-of-program questions - how you plan to keep contributing, the alumni personal email, and the mentoring opt-in - out of Wrap-up and into Project, between the first-contribution post and the halfway one, which is the order the Airtable view asks them in.

= 1.62.1 =
* Refreshes the Airtable field-name fixture: `Post Reflection: Choosing Your Team and Project copy` was confirmed a duplicated field and deleted from the base, so the table is 52 columns rather than 53. The report form never used it; this keeps the check that guards every field name honest.

= 1.62.0 =
* Adds a bulk invitation to the Students and Mentors screens: one button that invites everybody who has never been invited, with the count in the button so nobody presses it without reading how many people it reaches.
* The sending is reported as it goes - a progress bar, how many of how many have gone out, and when the next batch is due - because at ten every two minutes a few hundred invitations take the better part of an hour, and a screen that says nothing invites a second press.
* A Stop button cancels whatever is left. Messages already sent cannot be recalled; the rest can.
* Anybody already invited is skipped, in the queue itself and not only by the screen that fills it, so the button is safe to press twice.

= 1.61.0 =
* Adds the **Developer Track** as a third program, from the `Developer Track` status in Airtable. It has its own report form - the 150-hour form plus seven fields - its own Learn WordPress course, and its own reporting-form link.
* The track is now derived from the Airtable status rather than carried as an `is_50h` boolean. Two tracks fit a boolean; three do not, and a second flag beside the first would have made "both true" representable.
* **Fixes a field the report form could never save.** It read and wrote `Contribution Project Description`, which is not a column in the base - the column is `Contribution Project Summary` - so a student's project description neither loaded nor stored. Tests now check every field name against a fixture of the table's real columns.
* Adds email and checkbox controls to the report form, the latter with the hidden zero that makes unticking reach Airtable.

= 1.60.3 =
* A group session can be 60 minutes again. A number field's step counts from its min, so `min="1" step="5"` made the valid lengths 1, 6, 11 … 61 - rejecting 60, which was the field's own default. Reported by Celi Garoe in prerelease testing.

= 1.60.2 =
* **The "Need help?" retry now tries a different model.** "This model is currently experiencing high
  demand" is a statement about one model's capacity, so asking the same one again is asking the
  thing that is full - `gemini-flash-latest` answered 503 twice in a row while
  `gemini-flash-lite-latest` answered the same grounded question in three seconds.
* **The retry was never firing at all.** It was guarded on the first attempt having taken under 15
  seconds, on the reasoning that a busy provider fails fast; a grounded request takes 20 to 60
  seconds even when it works, so the guard never passed and the reader saw the error on the first
  failure. It is now guarded on the time actually left in the request.
* Fixes the model used when a site has none saved: it was `gemini-2.5-flash`, which Google has
  retired and which answers 404, so the fallback was itself a failure.

= 1.60.1 =
* The program repository moved from `WordPress/WPCredits-Tracker` to `WordPress/WPCredits`, and the
  old `wordpress.github.io/WPCredits-Tracker/` dashboard address now 404s. Links in the guides point
  at the new one.

= 1.60.0 =
* **The feedback surveys open one stage at a time.** *Half way* appears once *Getting started* is
  fully answered, and *Finishing up* once both are. The three forms ask the same three questions at
  three different points, and those answers only mean anything given months apart - a student who
  opens all three on their last day gives three copies of one opinion.
* Two things keep that from trapping anybody. A conditional follow-up that was never triggered does
  not count as unanswered, so a form cannot sit one question short of complete for a question nobody
  was asked. And **a form somebody has already written in is never taken away**, however incomplete
  the one before it - answers given in another order would otherwise be stranded behind it.
* The optional permissions at the end of the last form are not required to finish it, as it says.
* The summary counts the questions being *asked*: a finished form reads *all answered* rather than
  sitting a question short for a follow-up that did not apply.
* Says so on the page when a form is still to come, rather than leaving a gap that reads as
  something taken away, and in all three guides.

= 1.59.1 =
* Every heading in the three program guides now carries an anchor, written by `bin/build-docs.php`.
  An anchor is part of the document - it is what a shared link points at - so it is generated with
  the guide rather than added by a stylesheet at render time. Repeated headings are numbered, since
  the mentor guide carries the student guide in full and Resources appears in both.

= 1.59.0 =
* **The 1-to-5 scales are stars.** Every rating column behind them is an Airtable star column, so a
  row of numbered boxes here and five stars in the base were two renderings of one answer - and the
  people who read the answers see the stars. They fill from the left, the way a star rating means
  three rather than "the third", and hovering previews the same.
* The star is drawn as decoration and the number is not: the glyph is `aria-hidden`, and each radio
  keeps a name a screen reader can use - "3 of 5". Where `:has()` is unsupported the radio itself
  stays visible, because a scale that cannot show its own answer is worse than a plain one.
* The steps keep the width the dropdowns are measured against, so nothing else on the row moves.

= 1.58.5 =
* *Send my answers* is now **Save my answers**, which is what it does - the answers can be changed
  and saved again at any time.
* A rule under each survey, the twin of the one above them, so three stacked forms read as three
  rather than as one long one with headings in it.
* **More room throughout.** The line explaining what a form is for sat flush against the first
  group of questions with no gap at all. The gaps were nominally 1.25em, but they sit against notes
  set at 11px, so an em bought 14px of space where it read as 20 - they are in rem now and measure
  the same wherever they are used.

= 1.58.4 =
* The dropdowns end where the second step of a scale ends, and their value is centred.
* **The numbers are centred in their boxes.** `.wpcpm-field label { display: block }` in
  `calendar.css` is more specific than the rule that makes a step a flex box, so a step was not one
  - `justify-content: center` computed as "center" and did nothing, and every digit sat 8px from
  the left edge with 35px of space after it.
* A step is a fixed, border-box `--wpcpm-scale-step` wide, so the widths the dropdowns are measured
  against no longer depend on the padding around a digit.

= 1.58.3 =
* **The dropdowns line up with the scales and stop hogging the row.** They started 72px to the left
  of the 1 on every scale beside them, and ran 347px wide for answers like "Yes" and "Partly". They
  now begin at the same x as the first step and are the width of a scale.
* The indent both share is held in `rem` rather than `em`: a custom property resolves where it is
  used, so an em value came out 66px inside the 12px end label and 85px against the 13px dropdown -
  which is the misalignment it exists to prevent.

= 1.58.2 =
* **Every 1-to-5 scale now starts at the same place.** The label at the low end is part of the
  scale rather than a heading for it, so its width was deciding where the steps began - "Poor",
  "Not at all" and "Very hard" put three rows of steps at three different x positions on the same
  card. The low end takes a fixed column now, right-aligned against the 1 it labels.
* **The consent checkbox sits in front of its sentence again.** Two rules were taking it apart: the
  treatment that makes every question a block killed the flex row, and the report form's
  `width: 100%` on field inputs - loaded after this stylesheet - stretched the checkbox across the
  line and pushed its own words underneath it.
* *Feedback forms* moves below the rule that separates the surveys from the report. The rule
  belonged to the paragraph under the heading, so it was drawn between the heading and the text it
  introduces, leaving the heading up against the report form and labeling the wrong thing.
* *Save my report* and *Send my answers* are centred. Every question in these forms is left-aligned
  against one edge, so a button on that edge read as one more row of the last group rather than as
  the end of the form.

= 1.58.1 =
* **The surveys use the width of the card.** Questions on the left, answers aligned down the right,
  prose two boxes to a row - instead of every 1-to-5 scale wrapping onto two lines inside a 208px
  column with 1,176px of card empty beside it. The layout rules now sit two classes deep, because
  the report form's own column rule is loaded after this one and a rule of equal weight lost.
* **Fixes the two conditional follow-ups, which were shown to everybody.** Giving those fields a
  `display` of their own beat the `[hidden]` rule every browser ships, so the script hid them and
  nothing happened.
* Adds a *Feedback forms* heading above them, and gives every question one treatment - a scale's
  question is a span and the rest are labels, and they were styled as two different things.

= 1.58.0 =
* **The feedback surveys, on the Student Report Card.** Four short forms under *Your report form*,
  each its own toggle: *Getting started*, *Half way*, *Finishing up*, and - for anyone who did not
  finish - *Leaving the program*. They write to the Feedback table in Airtable, one row per student,
  so a stage fills in its own columns and leaves the rest alone.
* The question set is the one settled in issue #123 after the analysis of 242 responses, and the
  reasoning is encoded rather than left to whoever edits the form next:
  * **The three anchors repeat word for word** in the first three forms - overall experience,
    confidence contributing, and how much the mentor's support is helping - because that is what
    lets a student's answers be read as a line rather than three unrelated snapshots. The test
    suite asserts they are identical across the three.
  * **Two follow-ups are conditional**, shown only when the answer above them was poor: what
    slowed you down, and what is making the hours hard to reach. Asked of everybody they come back
    mostly blank. They stay visible without JavaScript, and never vanish once something has been
    typed into them.
  * **The eight retired questions are not asked**, and a test keeps them retired.
  * **Form 3's permissions are fenced off** in a box of their own that says it is optional: sharing
    a quote publicly and being contacted about opportunities are not feedback about the program.
* Ratings are 1-to-5 radio scales with both ends named, so they work without JavaScript, from the
  keyboard, and on a phone.
* Answers are prefilled from the record and can be changed at any time; each form's summary says
  how many of its questions are answered.
* A single-select answer is checked against the choices the column actually has, so a hand-edited
  form cannot add an option to the base or take the whole submission down with it.
* Adds `feedback_table` to the settings, and `WPCPM_Airtable::create_records()`.
* Fixes a fatal in `uninstall.php`, which still required the student profile editor deleted in
  1.52.0 - cleanup would have stopped there and left everything behind.

= 1.57.0 =
* **The student sync now runs every three hours** instead of once a day, so what people see on
  their cards is at most a few hours behind Airtable rather than up to a day. The mentors sync
  stays daily: it reads one WordPress.org profile per mentor, which is the expensive half.
* **A run already in progress is left to finish.** Starting a sync wipes the state and begins
  again, which was harmless once a day and is not at three hours - a slow run would be restarted
  from the top by the next one, and a site whose runs take longer than the gap would sync forever
  without ever completing. A run whose ticks have stopped is still restarted, since that one is
  not going to finish on its own.
* Sites upgrading are moved onto the new interval. A recurring event keeps the schedule it was
  created with, so the existing daily one is replaced rather than left in place - otherwise the
  code would say three hours and the site would go on syncing daily, with nothing to show the
  disagreement.
* Renames the *Daily sync* setting to *Automatic sync* and says what it actually does now.

= 1.56.3 =
* **What a student saves on the report form now shows on their card.** Their WordPress.org profile,
  Slack name, contribution team and personal website are asked for on the form but drawn on the
  cards, and the cards read the copy the sync leaves behind - so a student who had just chosen
  *Community* was shown "Not set" until the next weekly sync, with the answer sitting in Airtable
  the whole time. Saving now carries those four back into both cached copies of the row: the
  student's own, and the one inside their mentor's list. No extra Airtable request - the values
  written are the ones just accepted from the form.
* Pins that in `bin/test-student-program.php`, including the case that looks fixed: updating the
  student's copy and not the mentor's.

= 1.56.2 =
* **Restores the notes section on a student's card.** It was dropped by accident when the report
  disclosure took its place in the card; notes are the mentor's own record of their calls and
  nothing else on the page holds them. They sit beside the details table again.
* **A report opened from a mentor's page is read only for everyone, program managers included.**
  The capability said a manager may edit any report, so a manager reading a mentor's page got live
  boxes and a *Save my report* button over somebody else's answers. Whether a report may be edited
  is now the view's decision as well as the capability's: on a mentee card it is a record, and a
  manager still edits from the student's own card.
* Read only now means there is no form at all - no `<form>`, no nonce, no hidden fields, no submit
  - rather than a form with everything in it disabled.
* The report spans the full width of the card under the details table, instead of being auto-placed
  into the notes column at half width.
* Pins all of that in `bin/test-report-form.php`, asserted on the rendered markup: every control
  disabled, no save button, and the student's own form still editable.

= 1.56.1 =
* **A student's report opens on the mentor's card instead of loading a page.** It was a link
  dressed as a disclosure, which is not the same thing: pressing it navigated. It is a real
  `<details>` now, and the body is fetched the first time it is opened.
* **New route `wpcpm/v1/report/<record>`**, which serves one student's report rendered read only.
  A program manager may read any; a mentor may read the students assigned to them and nobody else,
  checked against the same mentee list their page is drawn from - so a record they were never
  given cannot be asked for by editing a URL.
* Fetched once and kept: closing and reopening does not ask again, and a request that fails clears
  the flag so the next open retries rather than staying broken until the page is reloaded.
* `render()` is split into the disclosure and its body, so the page and the route render the same
  markup and there is no second copy of the form to keep in step.

= 1.56.0 =
* **The group sessions panel splits in two.** What is planned stays on the left with the booked
  calls - that column is what is in the calendar. Planning one moves to the right, under the
  availability panel and in a box like it, because those two are the controls that *change* what is
  in the calendar. The explanation travels with the control rather than with the list, since it
  describes what pressing it does.
* **A student's report form opens from a disclosure, not a button.** Same triangle, same wording as
  the student's own card. It is still a link rather than a `<details>` with the form already
  inside: reading a report costs an Airtable request, and rendering sixty of them on every page
  load - for the fifty-nine nobody opened - is not a page a mentor would wait for.

= 1.55.1 =
* **Group sessions really do follow the diary now.** 1.55.0 put them in the same grid column, which
  was not enough: the availability form beside them spans those rows, and a spanning item has its
  height divided between the rows it covers - so the sessions still sat as far down the page as
  the form is tall. The diary and the sessions are one box on the left now, which does not care how
  tall the column beside it is.
* The left-hand side carries its own inset, so the sessions keep the margin the booked calls have.

= 1.55.0 =
* **A mentor can read their student's report form.** The button in the student's row linked to the
  Airtable form; the answers are on this site now, so the row offers *View report form* and the
  card shows it read only - `user_can_edit()` is false for a mentor, so it renders as a record
  rather than as something they could change.
* **Only the card that was asked for loads one.** Reading a report costs an Airtable request, and
  doing that for sixty cards on every page load would not be a page anybody waits for. The link
  carries the record and comes back to the same card.
* **Group sessions sit under the diary rather than under both columns.** An open availability form
  is tall, and spanning the row pushed the sessions the whole height of it down the page, leaving a
  column of white beside them.
* **"24 fields" is gone from beside "Your report form".** It was there to say how much was behind
  the disclosure, and what it said was "twenty-four things to do" - the opposite of the reason the
  form is grouped and headed at all.

= 1.54.1 =
* **Fixes the last hint in the project column falling through the bottom of the pair**, under the
  rule that follows it. The textareas there were stretched to `min-height: 100%` - right when the
  description was the only thing beside the team list and had to fill it, wrong once three
  questions were stacked in that column, because a percentage of an auto-height box resolved
  against the whole row. They take their own height now.
* **The published schedule sits under the availability toggle again, not under the open form.** It
  has to be readable with the form shut, which rules out the body, and it belongs under the
  control rather than over it - so it goes inside the summary, under the label, which is the one
  place that is both.

= 1.54.0 =
* **"Meetings and discussions you took part in" joins the column beside the team list**, under the
  project description and the post about choosing it. Three questions about the project in one
  column, with the tall list of teams beside all of them.
* A pair can now hold a **stack**: one cell of the pair with however many fields belong in it.
  Spanning the team list across N grid rows divided its height between them, so each question
  floated a third of the way down the column instead of following the one above it - this is one
  cell holding a column, which does not care how many questions there are.
* **The availability toggle sits above what it publishes**, and the panel takes the same border,
  radius and inset as the booked calls beside it, so the two halves of that section read as one
  thing rather than as a list next to a panel.

= 1.53.0 =
* **"Link to the Post 'Reflection: Choosing Your Team and Project'" moved beside the team**, under
  the project description. The team list is a column of its own and the two questions about the
  project now stack next to it.
* **The five course marks are headed *Enter your final grade*.** It is the one instruction that
  applies to all of them and it was nowhere on the form.
* **"Optional courses" moved under its three fields as a note.** Nothing had to be done for those
  courses, which is a thing to say about the answers rather than a name for them.
* **The availability disclosure is the control group sessions uses** - a plain summary with its own
  triangle, not a bar with a chevron bolted to the end. Two disclosures a few inches apart on one
  card should be the same thing. What is published moves out of the summary and above it, so it
  stays put whether the form is open or shut.

= 1.52.1 =
* **A divider opens the run of reflection links in Project**, under the contribution team and the
  project description. The two halves at the top are what a student is doing; everything below is
  what they did, and the two ran together. On the 50-hour track the same rule falls in the same
  place, above the meetings and discussions.

= 1.52.0 =
* **"Complete one of the following courses" sits under the three user levels**, set as a field
  hint. It was a heading over them reading *Minimum 1 of the following courses* - but it is a
  condition on the three answers, not a name for them, so it belongs where the other notes about
  filling something in belong.
* **The five course marks open with the same rule** the lessons below them do. They started a
  section of their own and had nothing to mark it, so they read as a continuation of the two
  contact questions above.
* Two new things a field can declare: `divider`, which opens a section with a rule and no heading
  where the labels already say what the run is, and `note`, which writes a line under a run rather
  than a heading over it.

= 1.51.2 =
* **The lesson headings inside a group look like headings.** *Minimum 1 of the following courses*,
  *Optional courses* and *Create your personal website* were set smaller and lighter than the field
  labels they introduce, so they read as a stray line of text and the fields under them looked like
  they belonged to whatever came before. Each now opens its section with a rule and takes the same
  uppercase tracking every other heading on the card uses - one step below the group's own legend,
  so the order reads group, lesson, field.
* The space says it too: generous above the rule, tight under the heading, so a heading sits with
  what it introduces rather than floating between two runs of fields.

= 1.51.1 =
* **The number boxes are the width of the answer.** 52px, which fits 100 and nothing more. The
  spinner arrows go with it - at this width they would sit on top of the number, and nobody steps
  a course mark up one at a time.
* **The three user levels line up with the marks above them.** They were wrapped in a paired row,
  and a pair makes its own grid - `auto-fit` collapsed it to three tracks where the group has
  four, so its boxes sat between the columns rather than in them. They are ordinary fields in the
  group's grid now; the heading above them is what keeps the three together.
* **Every row of the team list is the same height**, whether the team's name fits on one line or
  two, with more space between rows. Measured rather than eyeballed: all 25 rows are 36px.

= 1.51.0 =
* **Every number box is the same width, and narrow.** The widest answer any of them takes is three
  digits, and they were as wide as the column they sat in.
* **The question sits beside the box rather than above it.** A mark sheet is a list of names with a
  number against each; a two-character answer under a three-line label was mostly label. The
  columns are wider to suit, so the group still reads several to a row. Each field is capped at
  24em, so a box in a wide column stays near the question it answers.
* **The gap between a team's icon and its name is the same on every row.** The Dashicon glyphs are
  not all the same width, so the icon now sits in a fixed box of its own with the glyph centred in
  it.
* The hours box takes the same width as the rest, so the one number outside the form matches the
  twenty inside it.

= 1.50.1 =
* **The hours box is the height of every other number box.** Its row was set to `stretch`, so the
  input grew to the height of the button beside it - and the button was tall because "Save hours"
  had wrapped onto two lines. The button no longer wraps, and the two now match each other and the
  five grade boxes below them.
* **The project description starts on the same line as every other right-hand field.** Its pair was
  split 3:4 where every other pair is halves, which left the column a little to the left of the
  ones above it. Measured rather than eyeballed: all three right-hand columns now begin at the
  same offset.

= 1.50.0 =
* **Fixes the contribution teams scattering across the row.** Every field in this form was wrapped
  in a `<p>`, and **a `<p>` cannot contain a `<fieldset>`** - the parser closes the paragraph the
  moment one opens, so the checkbox list and the hint after it stopped being part of the field and
  became loose items in the grid. The team block is a `<div>` now. This is why the list sat beside
  its own label, and why the project description never moved up beside it.
* Two collisions the fix exposed, both from the list finally being inside `.wpcpm-field`: the
  form's `label { display: block }` stood every checkbox above its own name, and its
  `input { width: 100% }` made each checkbox as wide as its column. Both are answered rather than
  worked around - a check is a flex row, and its box is `width: auto`.
* **Team icons beside the team names**, the same ones the student's card and the mentor's table
  show, so a team is recognisable by its mark and not only by reading the name.
* **The hours box takes the report's own controls**, so the one number outside the form does not
  look like a different kind of field to the twenty inside it.
* The reflection links say what they are: *Link to the Post "Reflection: Choosing Your Team and
  Project"*, *"Your First Contribution"*, *"Halfway Check-In"*, and *Link to a WordPress event you
  have participated in (online or in person)*.

= 1.49.1 =
* **The paired fields in 1.49.0 never actually paired.** The rule giving a URL or a paragraph the
  full row was a descendant selector, so it also caught the fields *inside* a pair and told each of
  them to span it - the two halves stacked, and the pair was a pair in the markup only. It applies
  to the fields the group places itself now; a pair sets its own columns. Slack sits beside the
  WordPress.org profile, the reflection post beside the website, and the project beside the team.
* **The three WordPress User levels are one lesson**, headed *Minimum 1 of the following courses*
  and kept on a row together. They were three separate questions the grid packed wherever they
  fit, which left Advanced stranded on a line of its own.
* **The hours box is a box and a button on one line**, with the label over them and the hint under.
  It was drawn through the form's field renderer, which puts label, input and hint in one block and
  left the Save button an outsider beside all three.

= 1.49.0 =
* **Hours moved to *My course*, beside the button**, which now has two columns. It is the one
  number a student updates without having anything else to report, and it was the first question
  behind a disclosure holding twenty others. The box is the width of the answer now rather than
  the width of the card.
* **Fields that belong together share a row.** The two contact lessons, the website and the post
  about building it, and the contribution team beside the project it is for. The group packs
  whatever fits into a row, which is how the Slack box ended up in the middle of a run of course
  marks - a pair is wrapped now, so it stays a pair.
* **The team checkboxes run across rather than down.** Two dozen teams in one column was most of a
  screen before the next question.
* Renamed, to the program's own wording: *What you contributed* is **Describe your contribution
  project**, *Your personal website* is **Your personal website URL**, and the reflection post is
  **Link to the Post "Reflection: Building Your Personal Website"**.

= 1.48.0 =
* **The report form asks the three questions the profile editor used to.** *Your WordPress.org
  profile* and *Your Slack name* open Onboarding, where both course forms ask them, and the personal
  website was already there - which meant it was editable from two controls writing one Airtable
  column, the thing that had just been fixed for contribution teams. One question, one place.
* **The inline profile editor is gone**, with its handler, its validation and its flash message.
  *My profile* is a record now: the same details, read from the program, with nothing to press. A
  student changes them on the form, on the same page, a section further down.
* Nothing was lost with it. The team validation it owned moved with the question in 1.46.0, and
  `bin/test-handlers.php` exercises the same hostile shapes against the form's handler instead.

= 1.47.0 =
* **Conflict resolution is asked on both courses.** It was on the 50-hour track alone, which was
  the 50-hour form having been built first rather than a difference between the two. On *In Sensei*
  it sits between the voice course and the three user levels, the order that form uses.
* **Two lessons inside Onboarding are headed** - *Optional courses* and *Create your personal
  website* - so a mark for a course nobody had to take does not read as a missing answer, and the
  website pair reads as the lesson it belongs to rather than as more of the list above it.

= 1.46.0 =
* **The report form is grouped the way the Airtable form is** - *Total hours*, *Onboarding*,
  *Project*, *Wrap-up* - rather than by the kind of field each question happens to be. A student
  who has filled the Airtable form in before finds the same shape, and the two can be read side by
  side while both exist. The personal website sits in Onboarding on the long course and under
  Wrap-up on the 50-hour one, which is where each form has it.
* **Contribution teams are asked for on the report form again**, at the head of *Project*, above
  what you contributed. They came off the form in 1.45.0 on the reasoning that two controls writing
  one Airtable column invite two answers - which stands, so the profile editor no longer offers
  them. One question, one place, and that place is now the form the question belongs to.
* Removed the "Fill in what you have; you can come back and add the rest" line above the form. It
  said nothing the form does not.
* URLs take a full row like the prose fields do. A URL in a 13em column is as unreadable as a
  paragraph in one.

= 1.45.0 =
* **The report form is a disclosure, and its fields are grouped.** Twenty boxes in one run is a wall
  rather than a form; grouped into *Your hours*, *Course grades*, *Additional courses*, *Your
  project*, *Taking part* and *Your posts*, it reads as a few short questions and a student can
  answer the part they came for. The numbers sit several to a row because they are two characters
  wide; the prose takes the full width. Closed by default - it opens itself when there is a message
  to read, because a "Saved" behind a closed disclosure is a message nobody sees.
* **Contribution teams are no longer asked for on the report form.** They are chosen once, in *My
  profile*, and a second control writing the same Airtable column invited two answers to one
  question.
* **The sponsor company is off the form**, pending the Sponsors module that will own it. The
  Sponsors catalog the sync now builds stays, because that module will need it.
* **Removed the "Open the full form" link.** The fields *are* the report now, and a second route to
  the same record invited the same thing to be filled in two ways.
* In Sensei is 20 fields and In Sensei 50h is 8. `bin/test-report-form.php` pins both lists, and now
  also asserts that every field lands in a declared group - a field with an unknown group would
  render nowhere at all, invisible and impossible to fill in.

= 1.44.0 =
* **The Report form section is the report form now**, filled in on the Student Report Card rather
  than only linked to - and it differs by track: twenty-two fields for *In Sensei*, ten for
  *In Sensei 50h*, with the 50-hour course asking for a final project report and the conflict
  resolution grade that the longer course does not, and none of its reflection posts.
* **Hours and the grades are the student's to type.** They are marked elsewhere and copy the score
  across, so this records a result rather than deciding one.
* Values are read **live from Airtable**, cached for five minutes and cleared on save. The sync does
  not carry these fields, and adding them to it would mean a form showing "Not set" for everything
  until the next run - the trap that hid *Field of study* on every student card.
* Every value is validated by type before it goes anywhere: a grade takes digits between 0 and 100
  and understands a comma decimal, an empty box **clears** the column rather than being refused,
  and an unreadable one is named in the message rather than saved as zero. One bad answer no longer
  costs the other twenty-one - an Airtable PATCH fails whole.
* Linked-record fields - *Main Contribution Team* and *Company* - are checkbox lists validated
  against catalogs the sync builds, so a hand-edited form cannot write an unknown link.
* **Sponsors is a third lookup table**, for the Company field; `LOOKUPS_VERSION` moves to 3, so a
  site upgrading refetches the catalogs on its next sync. Settings gain the Sponsors table and its
  name field.
* A mentor can read a student's report but not edit it: the report is the student's own account of
  their work. A program manager can, for a student locked out of their account.
* The prefilled Airtable form stays, below the fields, as a second route.
* Adds `bin/test-report-form.php`, which pins both field lists by name - Airtable exposes no way to
  read a view's visible fields, so the lists are maintained by hand and would otherwise drift in
  silence.

= 1.43.2 =
* **Actually fixed that warning.** Asking `get_users()` for `'ID'` is documented to return a flat
  list of IDs, and on this site it returns `stdClass` rows regardless - something in the stack
  filters the query - so 1.43.1 moved the `intval()` from core into the plugin rather than removing
  it. `WPCPM_Roles::id_of()` now resolves an int, a numeric string, a row object or a `WP_User`
  without assuming which arrived. Verified by rendering all four dashboard paths with an error
  handler attached: zero notices.

= 1.43.1 =
* **Fixed a PHP warning on every Student Report Card render.** Looking a student's mentor up asked
  `get_users()` for whole rows, and on this stack `WP_User_Query` hands those to core's user-meta
  cache as raw objects - so `update_meta_cache()` tried to `intval()` one and warned. Both lookups
  now ask for a flat list of IDs and hydrate what they need. Found by rendering the four dashboard
  paths with an error handler attached rather than by reading the page.

= 1.43.0 =
* **New: group sessions.** A mentor announces a session - date, time, length, how many places and
  what it is about - and their students join it. An office hour rather than a slot: it is not carved
  out of the weekly hours, and a mentor can run one at a time they would never offer privately. It
  **does** block that time from one-to-one booking, so nobody books them over it.
  * Students join and leave from *My mentor call*; leaving frees the place. Joining counts towards
    the mentor's per-student limit on upcoming calls, because an upcoming session is one.
  * Everybody who joins gets a calendar invitation, the 24-hour reminder goes to all of them, and
    canceling the session tells everybody on it.
  * **One note for the whole group.** The mentor writes it once and it appears on every attendee's
    card, counts for each of them in the triage - so nobody who attended is left in *Need a call* -
    and one deletion removes it from everyone.
  * Built on the existing call post type rather than a second one, which is why the diary, the
    reminder sweep, the slot blocking, the cancellation mail and the ICS builder needed no changes.
    A call with no capacity marked is still a one-to-one call, so nothing was migrated.
* **The Student Report Card's "My course and report form" is two sections**, *My course* and
  *Report form*, stacked. One section holding two buttons read as a single task with two links
  rather than the two separate things a student does.
* **A student can select several contribution teams.** Airtable's field is a linked record and
  already took a list, so this is a checkbox list rather than a single select - visible at once and
  usable on a phone. Every submitted ID is checked against the catalog, so a hand-edited form cannot
  write an unknown link.
* **"Accessibility needs" now reads "None" rather than an amber "Not set" when it is empty.** A
  blank there is the student's answer, not missing data, and flagging it asked mentors to chase
  something already settled. Fields may now declare what their blank means.
* **A student's row heals itself from the mentor's copy.** Two syncs write two caches of the same
  student and are not run together, so whichever has not run since a field was added showed "Not
  set" for data sitting in the other cache - which is what happened to *Field of study* on every
  student card while 546 of 558 mentor rows had it. The student's own value always wins; the
  mentor's copy only ever fills a blank.
* Adds `bin/test-group-sessions.php` and `bin/test-student-program.php`, and listed `study` and
  `access` in both syncs' opening state - they auto-vivified, but the asymmetry with `tutors` is
  what made a stale cache read as a code difference.

= 1.42.0 =
* **Three program guides**, one per audience, in `docs/`: a student guide, a mentor guide that
  contains the whole student guide, and a program manager guide that contains both plus the
  wp-admin walkthrough - every screen, every setting, the access levels, the sync and a
  what-to-check-when table. Each guide is complete on its own because the access levels do not
  nest: a mentor cannot open a Student-level page, so linking to it instead of repeating it would
  send them to the restricted notice.
* **`bin/build-docs.php` assembles them from one set of sections**, so a section used by more than
  one guide is written once. It emits Markdown for reading in the repository and block markup for
  the published pages, resolving each image reference differently for the two.
* The guides are published at `/student-guide/`, `/mentor-guide/` and `/program-manager-guide/`,
  gated to Student level, Mentor level and Administrators only.
* Screenshots are mockups built from the plugin's own markup and the theme's stylesheets with
  invented people, not captures of live Report Cards - real ones carry students' names, emails,
  photos and call notes, and these documents are read by everybody on the program.

**Fixed while writing them**, all three found by documenting what the code actually does:

* The Overview screen said "The program in four modules" and the Modules screen "the four audiences
  above". Both have been wrong since Sponsors was added.
* The Header notices tool described its audiences as "students, mentors, institutions or
  administrators", which has not included sponsors since 1.41.0.
* This readme still described notices as posts edited in the block editor. They have been classic
  editors saving to one option since 1.22.0.

= 1.41.0 =
* **New module: Sponsors**, with a `wpcpm_sponsor` role cloned from Subscriber and a
  `wpcpm_view_sponsor_content` marker capability, wired in exactly like the other audiences -
  it appears in the admin menu, Administrator is granted its capability on activation and loses
  it on uninstall, "Sponsor level" joins the access control in the editor, header notices can be
  aimed at Sponsors, and uninstall moves sponsor accounts back to Subscriber. Like Institutions,
  the module registers its role and reserves its screen; sponsor-facing functionality is not
  built yet.
* **The role schema version moved to 2**, so the new role reaches sites that update by dropping
  in files rather than by re-activating the plugin.
* **Administrator's capabilities are now derived from the roles** instead of being listed by
  hand in two places. Adding an audience meant remembering to grant its marker capability on
  activation *and* remove it on uninstall, and missing the second left the capability behind on
  a site that had removed the plugin.
* Adds `bin/test-roles.php`, which asserts the wiring a new audience needs rather than any one
  behavior: unique prefixed slugs, one marker capability each, grant and removal reading the
  same list, the module loaded and registered, and the notice audience actually tested. It loops
  over the roles, so the next audience is covered the day it is added.

= 1.40.1 =
* **"Updates" is now "Program updates and announcements"** on both Report Cards. One word left it
  ambiguous next to WordPress's own update notices; the heading now says what the column holds.

= 1.40.0 =
* **Updates now lead the Resources section, on the left.** What is new changes; the guide and
  the assistant do not, and a fixed pair of buttons in the first column trains people to skip
  the half of the section that is different every time they open the page. Swapped in the
  markup rather than turned around in CSS, so what a screen reader hears is what the page
  shows.
* **The sentence under the "Need help?" button follows the button again.** It pinned itself to
  the bottom of its column, which is as tall as the updates beside it - so on a card with a few
  announcements the sentence sat a long way under the buttons it describes and read as
  belonging to nothing.

= 1.39.2 =
* **My course and report form moved above My mentor call** on the Student Report Card. The two
  buttons a student comes to the page to press were at the foot of it, under a section tall
  enough - a month grid beside a day's worth of times - to push them off the screen. Order is
  now My profile and My mentor, then the course and report form, then the calendar.

= 1.39.1 =
* **"Need help?" answers read as prose again.** Providers answer in Markdown whichever way the
  instructions are worded, and `wpautop()` knows nothing about it - so an answer arrived with
  literal `**During weekly syncs:**` around every emphasis and a column of asterisks where a
  list belonged. Bold is now bold and bullets are a real list, in the panel, the block and the
  admin preview alike. Only those two constructs are handled: anything more is a Markdown
  parser, and a wrong one is worse than none.

= 1.39.0 =
* **The Updates column now shows whose card it is, not what the viewer may read.** A program
  manager may read every access level, so mentor announcements were appearing on the Student
  Report Card and student ones on the Mentor Report Card whenever a manager looked at either -
  and a manager had no way of seeing the list a student actually gets. Each card now lists
  Public plus its own audience's level, the same question the "Need help?" button asks.
* The reader's own permission is still checked underneath, so the audience can only narrow the
  list, never widen it: a student sent a mentor-audience render still sees nothing extra.

= 1.38.0 =
* **The Resources section is now two columns: Resources on the left, Updates on the right.**
  Updates lists the newest posts in the *Updates* category, newest first, with a link to the
  category archive when there are more than the column shows.
* **Who sees which update is decided by the post's own "Program access" level.** Public reaches
  everybody; *Student level* reaches students; *Mentor level* mentors; *Institution level*
  institutions; *Administrators only* nobody else. Program managers read every level, as
  everywhere else in the plugin. Enforced twice - by the existing query filter and again on
  every post the column is about to list - so a bypassed query filter cannot leak an
  announcement.
* The example question in the question box is now *"How does the WordPress Credits Program
  work?"*, which any audience could ask, rather than a mentor's onboarding question.
* Shortened the note under the button to "Ask anything about the program or WordPress itself,
  and get an answer."
* No category called *Updates* means an empty column that says so, not a broken one. The plugin
  does not create the category: it does not own the site's taxonomy.

= 1.37.0 =
* The Slack logo in the Resources section is now exactly as tall as the buttons beside it, so
  the three read as one row.

= 1.36.0 =
* The Slack logo in the Resources section is now a plain link rather than a button: no border,
  no fill, just the logo. A box around a logo fights the logo, and the artwork reads as
  somewhere to go on its own.
* Drawn a little larger to make up for having no button around it.

= 1.35.0 =
* The Resources section's Slack button now carries Slack's published logo - the four-color mark
  and the "slack" wordmark together - taken from Slack's own brand asset rather than drawn here.
* Still exactly the height of the labeled buttons beside it, scaled from the logo's own
  proportions so it is never stretched.

= 1.34.0 =
* The Resources section on each Report Card now opens with a Slack button carrying Slack's own
  mark, before the guide: the students channel on the Student Report Card, the mentors channel
  on the Mentor Report Card.
* Icon only and the same height as the labeled buttons beside it - 54px either way - and
  outlined rather than filled, because Slack's mark keeps its own four colors and needs a
  light background to read against. It is named for screen readers, which get nothing from an
  icon.
* This is the one brand mark the plugin ships. `WPCPM_Icons` otherwise draws its own line
  icons on purpose; Slack's guidelines permit their mark for pointing at Slack, so it is
  reproduced unmodified and kept out of the line-icon set so it cannot be used as one.
* The two dashboards no longer filter the section through `wp_kses_post()`, which strips
  `<svg>` outright and would have left an empty button. A check now fails if either starts
  doing so again.

= 1.33.0 =
* The Resources section on each Report Card now links that reader's own handbook guide, before
  the "Need help?" button: **Student guide** on the Student Report Card and **Mentor guide** on
  the Mentor Report Card. Filled rather than outlined, and first, because the guide is the
  thing to read and the assistant is for when it has not answered the question - the same
  relationship "Open your course" has to "Open your report form".
* The guide shows whether or not an AI provider is configured, and whether or not this
  audience may ask questions. Those govern the button beside it and nothing else; hiding a
  handbook link because an API key is missing would make no sense to anybody looking at the
  page.
* The "Need help?" button requires a provider again, so it can no longer open a panel that
  has nothing to answer with.

= 1.32.0 =
* **Citations now show the actual page, not just the domain.** Google returns an opaque
  redirect and gives only the hostname, so the list read "wordpress.org" four times over.
  Following each redirect one hop - about 0.2 seconds apiece - yields the real address, which
  is now shown under a name taken from the page itself: "Certificate graduation -
  make.wordpress.org", with the full path beneath it. Links go straight to the page rather
  than through Google.
* That also makes the site check stronger: it is now made against where the page actually is,
  rather than against a label the provider supplied. A citation labeled wordpress.org that
  resolves somewhere else is refused. A redirect that cannot be followed still yields a
  citation, named by its host.
* The same page cited twice arrives as two different redirects; it is now shown once.
* The privacy note is prefixed "NOTE:" and set in italic, in the panel and on the page.

= 1.31.2 =
* **Fixes a busy AI service being reported as a retired model.** "This model is currently
  experiencing high demand" was matched on the word "model" and turned into "no longer
  available - change it in the plugin settings", which sent people to change a setting that
  was correct. Failures are now told apart by HTTP status, plus a short list of unmistakable
  phrases for the retired case, because Google has answered 404 for one retired model and 400
  for another.
* A reader now gets the right advice for each: busy means try again in a minute, a refused
  request points at the API key, and only a genuinely unavailable model sends anybody to the
  settings. The provider's own wording is kept alongside either way.
* **Retries once when the service is busy.** "High demand" is transient and fails within a
  second or two, so there is room to try again inside the same request rather than asking
  somebody to press the button again. Only on a fast failure - after a slow one there is no
  time left, and a second attempt would only trip the browser's own limit.

= 1.31.1 =
* **Fixes answers timing out.** The provider was given 25 seconds; measured against this
  site's own key, three ordinary questions took 9.4, 18.7 and 24.1 seconds, so the limit was a
  coin toss rather than a margin and the failure was a cURL 28 with no answer. Raised to 60.
* **The panel shows a progress bar and a running count of seconds while it waits.** A
  ten-to-twenty-five second wait behind a line of static text reads as a page that has
  stopped. Indeterminate on purpose - nothing reports how far through a web search is, and a
  bar that pretended to know would stall at 90%. It also gives up on its own after 75 seconds
  rather than spinning for ever.
* **Corrects settings text that described a design the plugin no longer has.** Four claims
  were false once the local copy was removed: that there is a private copy of the
  documentation, that it works with no provider at all, that nothing you type leaves the site,
  and that there is a daily refresh keeping an index. A check now fails if any of them
  reappears.
* Removes the note about contact details coming from a mentor's WordPress.org profile.

= 1.31.0 =
* **Google AI Studio is the only answer provider.** The OpenAI-compatible path, the endpoint
  field and the table of free services are gone; a stored provider that no longer exists is
  migrated across. Google's is the one that searches the web for free and returns the
  citations this arrangement depends on.
* **Fixes answers arriving with no citations and marked unverified.** The token ceiling was
  800, and Gemini returns `groundingMetadata` *empty* when a grounded answer is cut off - so
  the limit was not shortening answers, it was silently destroying every source. Raised to
  2048.
* **Fixes the citation filter reading a field that does not exist.** The API documents the
  source domain as `web.domain`; it actually arrives in `web.title`, with an opaque redirect
  as the URI. The filter read `domain`, found nothing, and would have refused every real
  citation. It now reads either, and refuses anything it cannot place on one of the four
  sites.
* The default model is `gemini-flash-latest`, an alias. Both `gemini-2.0-flash` and
  `gemini-2.5-flash` were retired during development, each time leaving sites with a refused
  request and no answer; an alias cannot be retired out from under a site. Sites on a retired
  default are moved across automatically, and a model chosen by hand is left alone.
* A provider error mentioning the model now says the model needs changing, instead of
  suggesting you try again - which for a retired model would never have worked.
* **Fixes the Resources section never appearing on the Student Report Card.** Choosing
  "Students and institutions as well" changed nothing, because the section had also been
  removed from that page outright - two mechanisms for one decision, and the setting lost. The
  audience setting is now the only authority.
* Removes the note about contact details coming from a mentor's WordPress.org profile.

= 1.30.1 =
* **Fixes settings that would not save.** The save handler read from a hand-written list of
  field names, and twenty-one settings the form renders were missing from it - including the
  AI provider and its API key, the whole mentor-checker card, the linked-table names, past
  student statuses and the student inactive rule. Those fields rendered, accepted what you
  typed, posted it, and discarded it without a word.
* The list is gone. The handler now derives the fields from the settings defaults, so adding a
  setting can no longer mean forgetting the one place that lets it through.
* New `bin/test-settings.php` drives the real save with a real request and fails if any
  rendered setting does not survive the round trip - plus the awkward shapes: an unticked
  checkbox, the masked API key being posted back, an unknown provider, and a non-http endpoint.

= 1.30.0 =
* **Need help? no longer keeps a copy of the documentation.** The AI provider searches
  wordpress.org, make.wordpress.org, learn.wordpress.org and developer.wordpress.org itself.
  Gone with it: the passage table, the resumable sync, two cron hooks, the progress bar, the
  per-source switches and about 1,500 lines of retrieval code. Nothing is stored, so nothing
  refreshes and nothing goes stale.
* **What that costs, stated plainly.** With no provider configured there is now no answer at
  all - there is nothing left to fall back on - and the screens say so rather than returning
  an empty box.
* **Two safeguards in place of the guarantee.** Google's search tool has no site filter, so
  the sites are named in the system instruction and every citation that comes back is checked
  against them: anything from elsewhere is not shown, and an answer citing nothing from those
  sites is **marked as unverified** in the panel, on the page and on the admin screen. The
  host check matches on the host's tail, so `developer.wordpress.org` counts and
  `wordpress.org.example.com` does not.
* Gemini's default model is now `gemini-2.5-flash`, which grounds noticeably better than
  2.0-flash and is on the same free tier. The OpenAI-compatible provider still works and reads
  citations where the service returns them - OpenRouter's `:online` models and Perplexity do;
  a plain chat model returns none and its answers are marked unverified.
* Uninstall removes everything every version of this module ever created, including the table
  and schedules belonging to classes that no longer exist. A check in `bin/test-handbook.php`
  fails if any of those names is dropped from the removal path.

= 1.29.1 =
* Removing the plugin now removes everything Need help? created. Three things were being
  left behind: the per-person rate counters, the posts an earlier version stored pages in -
  invisible to `get_posts()` because that post type is no longer registered - and the
  assistant's own page. The page is deleted only when nobody has written on it.
* A check in `bin/test-handbook.php` now fails if the module writes an option, transient,
  table or cron hook that the removal path does not name. The mistake it catches is a
  forgotten line, which nothing else would surface until somebody deleted the plugin.

= 1.29.0 =
* **Need help? now answers from all of the WordPress documentation, not just one handbook**:
  make.wordpress.org's team handbooks, Learn WordPress courses and lessons, the
  documentation site, the nine developer handbooks and the wordpress.org pages - including
  wordpress.org/education/. Around 3,200 pages. Each source is switched on or off on its own
  screen, and switching one off removes what it contributed.
* Two things are left out on purpose and can be added if wanted: developer.wordpress.org's
  code reference - 12,230 functions, hooks, classes and methods, four times everything else
  combined - and make.wordpress.org's meeting notes.
* **A real search index.** Passages now live in their own table with a MySQL full-text index,
  which narrows thirteen thousand of them to a couple of hundred candidates before BM25
  re-ranks those in PHP. Holding the whole corpus in memory was right for one handbook and
  an out-of-memory error at this size.
* **A progress bar, because the first read takes minutes.** The read happens in slices and
  is resumable: the browser advances it while somebody is watching, cron advances it when
  nobody is, and it survives leaving the screen. It reuses the plugin's existing progress
  component rather than adding a second one.
* Everything user-facing is called **Need help?**. On the Mentor Report Card it is a
  **Resources** section built from the same markup as "My course and report form".

= 1.28.1 =
* The assistant is called **"Need help?"** everywhere it appears.
* **Mentors and program managers only, by default.** The handbook describes running the
  program rather than being on it, so students no longer see the assistant unless somebody
  widens the audience deliberately - the setting still offers students and institutions, or
  anybody logged in, or managers alone.
* Removed from the Student Report Card entirely. Restricting the audience would have hidden
  it from students anyway, but a manager inspecting a student's card would still have seen it
  on a page that belongs to the student. It lives on the Mentor Report Card.
* The button wears the plugin's own `wpcpm-button` classes, so the companion theme's
  treatment of the course and report buttons covers it rather than there being a second kind
  of button on the same card.

= 1.28.0 =
* **The handbook assistant is no longer a page.** It opens in a slide-over panel from "Ask
  the handbook" in the site header, and from a prompt at the foot of both Report Cards.
  Questions arise while somebody is looking at a student record, not on a page they have to
  remember exists - and the answer now appears beside what they were reading instead of
  replacing it.
* Answers arrive over a REST endpoint, which makes the same access decision the page does:
  logged out, outside the audience, or the assistant switched off all refuse it.
* **A new OpenAI-compatible provider**, so Groq, OpenRouter, Cerebras, Mistral, Together and
  GitHub Models all work with one implementation. Trying a different free service - or a
  different model on the same one - is now two settings and a key rather than new code. The
  settings screen lists four services with a working endpoint and model for each.
* The rules the model must follow are sent as a system message rather than folded in above
  the extracts, which chat models follow noticeably better. Gemini gets them as a
  `systemInstruction` for the same reason.
* No page is created on activation any more. An existing one keeps working and the tool
  screen says so, in case you would rather delete it.
* The inline block submits back to whatever page it is on, so it works anywhere and needs no
  page of its own - and it carries the rest of the query string with it, so asking a question
  from a dashboard does not lose which student was being looked at.

= 1.27.0 =
* Switching the handbook assistant off now removes it from the site rather than leaving a
  page that renders nothing. The page is unpublished, so it drops out of navigation menus and
  the sitemap and has no URL to land on, and the shortcode renders nothing anywhere for
  anybody - a manager included. Switching it back on republishes the same page, with its slug
  and anything written on it intact.
* A page unpublished by hand stays unpublished. Only a *change* of the setting moves it, so
  the plugin never overrules an administrator who did it deliberately, and upgrading never
  moves a page at all.
* **The admin section "Tools" is now called "Modules"** - the menu item, the screen and the
  Overview heading. The page slugs are unchanged, so existing bookmarks still work.

= 1.26.0 =
* **New: the Education Handbook assistant.** A private question box over a synced copy of the
  WordPress Education Handbook, for logged-in people on the program. Ask it something and it
  finds the handbook sections that answer it, quotes them, and links back to make.wordpress.org.
* The handbook is read through the REST API that make.wordpress.org already publishes - no
  scraping - and split at the headings its authors wrote, so a question about one thing gets
  the section about that thing rather than a page covering five. 58 pages become 219
  answerable sections. Refreshed daily; pages that have not changed are skipped.
* Ranking is Okapi BM25, computed in PHP at the moment a question is asked. There is no
  index to keep in step and nothing to go stale, because the corpus is small enough that
  scoring all of it is cheaper than maintaining an index of it.
* **It works with no AI provider at all**, and that is the default: answers are quoted
  straight from the handbook and nothing you type leaves the site. Setting a provider and key
  in Settings has the answer written in prose instead, grounded strictly in the retrieved
  sections and told to admit when the handbook does not cover the question. Google AI Studio
  (Gemini) ships as a provider; `wpcpm_handbook_generate` accepts others.
* Whichever provider is on, the quoted answer is always produced first, so a provider that
  is down, misconfigured, rate-limited or out of quota degrades the answer instead of
  removing it. Per-person hourly and site-wide daily ceilings keep a free tier from being
  spent in an afternoon.
* Switchable on and off in Settings, with its own audience setting: students, mentors,
  institutions and managers by default, or anybody logged in, or managers only. Never anybody
  logged out, whatever the setting says, and the shortcode refuses to draw for a visitor even
  on a public page.
* The tool screen shows what is stored, when it was last read, where people ask, and a
  try-a-question box that shows exactly what somebody on the program would get.

= 1.25.2 =
* Recovers header notices that stopped appearing after 1.24.0. Moving notices off the
  block-editor post type read the post and nothing else, so an audience whose post had been
  created empty lost sight of text that was still sitting in the settings option from before
  any of this existed. The recovery now falls back to that older copy.
* The recovery is a revision counter rather than a one-shot flag, so a site it has already
  half-finished can be revisited - the same lesson the page-title rename learned. Anything
  written in the current editor always wins, so a rewritten notice is never reverted.

= 1.25.1 =
* Fixes mentors and students who are linked to an Airtable record but do not hold the
  Mentor or Student role still landing on the wp-admin dashboard. Both redirects tested the
  role alone, while everything else in the plugin - including the toolbar link to the page -
  counts the record link too. The result was an account the plugin recognized as a mentor
  everywhere except the one place that would have taken them to their page.
* Somebody whose mentoring has ended is still not redirected. Going inactive removes the
  role and leaves the Airtable link in place on purpose, and the page it would send them to
  has nothing on it.
* Administrators are unaffected. Starting from the wider test brings in administrators the
  sync has linked to a mentor record, and the existing capability exclusions keep them in
  wp-admin where they need to be.

= 1.25.0 =
* **Mentors and students are now actually redirected to their Report Card when they log in.**
  They always ended up there, but by way of the wp-admin dashboard: the `login_redirect`
  filter stepped aside whenever a destination had been "requested", and core's login form
  carries a hidden `redirect_to` whose default value is the admin URL - so it stepped aside
  on every single login and never redirected anybody. The `admin_init` fallback covered for
  it one hop later, which is why nothing looked wrong.
* The admin root now counts as "nowhere in particular", so a real destination is still
  honoured: a mentor or student bounced off gated content through the login form still lands
  on the page they asked for, and so does anyone sent to a specific admin screen.
* `WPCPM_Request::is_explicit_redirect()` holds that decision once, rather than the same
  subtle test being written out in both dashboards where one could be fixed and the other
  forgotten.
* New `bin/test-login-redirect.php`, driving the filter with the arguments `wp-login.php`
  really passes rather than the ones that would agree with the old code.

= 1.24.2 =
* Fixes "Email me the mentor invitation" sending the student invitation. The two buttons post
  the audience, and the handler was reading it from the query string, so it fell back to
  `student` whichever one was pressed. `WPCPM_Request` gains a `posted_key()` to go with the
  `posted_id()` it already had.
* `bin/check-references.php` now also reports a `$_GET` read inside a form handler. This one
  could not fail loudly - the read returns the fallback and the feature carries on doing the
  wrong thing - so it is worth a static check rather than a hope.

= 1.24.1 =
* Fixes the sample invitation printing the same address twice. WordPress puts two URLs in
  that email - a one-use reset link carrying a key, then the plain login page - and the
  sample stood the login URL in for both, so it looked like a duplicated link. The stand-in
  now keeps the real shape and is visibly an example. A real invitation was never affected.
* The invitation now says which of those two addresses does what. Unlabelled, a keyed
  reset link followed by a bare login URL reads as the same address twice.

= 1.24.0 =
* **Bookings and cancellations carry a calendar invitation.** Two people agreeing a
  half-hour slot across two timezones previously had to transcribe a date out of an email
  and type it into a calendar by hand, twice, correctly. The cancellation reuses the
  booking's own event ID, so it withdraws the call rather than adding a second one.
* **Mentors can say where the call happens.** A "Where we meet" link beside your
  availability goes into both confirmations and the calendar invitation, so nobody has to
  arrange the video room separately afterward. A mentor who has not set one is told so in
  their own confirmation, where it is still fixable.
* **A reminder goes out the day before.** A call booked four weeks ahead is a call somebody
  forgets, and the confirmation was read a month earlier. Nothing is sent for a call booked
  inside the reminder window - there the confirmation *is* the reminder.
* **Mail is sent in the recipient's language.** Templates are now built inside
  `switch_to_user_locale()`. They were translated in the site's language before, so a
  student whose profile is Italian was reading English.
* **Replies go somewhere.** Every notification carries a `Reply-To` for the other party, so
  answering "Call booked with your mentor" reaches the mentor instead of `wordpress@`.
* **The invitation email says what it is.** Students and mentors get different copy naming
  the program, what they are to it and what to do first, around the username and reset link
  WordPress generates. A bare "Login Details" from a site you do not recognize reads as
  phishing. It also says how to get a fresh link once the old one has expired.
* Invitations are queued and sent a few at a time instead of ninety inside one sync request,
  where a timeout or a mail limit could swallow an unknown number of them.
* Wording fixes: the student's own confirmation no longer refers to them in the third
  person; a canceled call tells mentors and students each what *they* can do next; a
  cancellation states its timezone and carries a link, as the booking already did; and an
  administrator canceling on someone's behalf is named as "a program manager" rather than
  by a name the student has never seen.
* The cancellation subject now names the date, so a mentor with three booked calls can tell
  which one it is about.
* A call crossing midnight in the reader's timezone states the end date. "11:45 pm - 12:15
  am" previously read as ending fourteen hours before it started.
* New on Settings: send yourself a sample invitation as either audience, and a log of recent
  mail with what the site did with it. "The student says they got nothing" was unanswerable
  before, because every caller discarded what `wp_mail()` reported.
* New filters: `wpcpm_mail` over subject, body and headers together; `wpcpm_call_ics` over
  the calendar file; `wpcpm_call_reminder_lead` over the reminder's lead time.

= 1.23.0 =
* **The mentor page is titled "Mentor Report Card"**, matching the student side. An install
  that still has the "My Students" title the plugin created is renamed once on upgrade; a
  page renamed by hand is left alone. The slug stays `mentor-dashboard` - the theme matches
  its template on it.
* The mentor's name steps down from `<h1>` to a paragraph, the same shape the student card
  uses for the student's name. It was the page's heading while the page had no title of its
  own; now the title is, and two `<h1>`s is not a document outline.
* The toolbar link and the "Mentor landing page" setting name the page by its new title
  rather than pointing at a "My Students" page that no longer exists.

= 1.22.0 =
* **Header notices go back to a plain editor.** Each notice is written in the classic editor
  on the Header notices tool screen - four editors and one Save button - instead of opening
  the block editor on a hidden post. A notice is a paragraph with a link in it; it did not
  need revisions, autosave or a screen with no way back to the tool.
* Notices are stored as markup in one option again. Anything written while they were posts is
  moved into that option once, on upgrade, with its block markup rendered to HTML on the way
  in, so nothing already published is lost. The old posts are left alone rather than deleted.
* The classic editor keeps its media button, so a notice can still hold links, images, lists
  and headings. It is deliberately not the `teeny` editor, which drops that button.
* Saving reports its outcome through the one-shot message store rather than a query
  argument, so reloading the screen no longer claims a save that did not happen.

= 1.21.0 =
* **Coding standards: both projects now pass WordPress Coding Standards with zero
  violations**, down from 194 in the plugin and 11 in the theme. `phpcs.xml.dist` in each
  pins the standard, so `phpcs` with no arguments is the whole check, and
  `sh bin/check-standards.sh` runs it. Every exclusion in those files is a path WordPress
  dictates the name of, or a sniff whose default does not apply here - bounded dashboard
  meta queries, and `numberposts` ceilings that exist so a runaway query cannot hang a page
  - each with the reason recorded. Nothing silences a category of mistake.
* Beyond formatting, the sniffs surfaced eleven real things: a stale docblock missing four
  keys `render_row()` reads, three parameters documented under names the signature no longer
  used, four missing translator comments on placeholder strings, an unparenthesized
  `||`/`&&` expression that was correct but only if you know the precedence table, and - the
  one worth having - **several `phpcs:ignore` annotations that had drifted onto the line
  above the code they described and silently stopped applying.**
* That last one pointed at real duplication: eleven near-identical
  `isset($_GET[…]) ? sanitize(…) : ''` reads, each needing its own annotation. They now go
  through `WPCPM_Request`, which writes the unslash-sanitize-default sequence once and keeps
  the "this is view state, not form data" note beside the three reads it describes. No raw
  `$_GET` access is left outside it.
* Added `VariableAnalysis` to both rulesets, and it immediately earned its place: renaming
  three reserved-keyword parameters (`$class`, `$default`, `$list`) left dangling references
  in the method bodies that `php -l` cannot see and that would have returned null at
  runtime.


* **Header notices are edited in the block editor.** Each notice is now a post, which is
  what makes that possible - blocks are a property of post content and the editor is bound
  to a post, so no settings field can host one. Revisions, autosave and the media library
  come with it. The tool screen lists the four with their status and an Edit link.
* Existing notices are carried over automatically: whatever was written in the old settings
  fields becomes the post's content on first load.
* The post type is private and every capability maps to `wpcpm_manage_program` with
  `map_meta_cap` off - mapping to the `post` type would have let any editor or author on the
  site rewrite a notice shown to every student.
* **Notices now appear at the top of the page's content** rather than above the site
  header. On `wp_body_open` they landed over the chrome, outside the page; a notice belongs
  at the top of the page somebody is actually reading. Rendered once, on the main singular
  query - `the_content` also runs for excerpts, other loops, feeds and REST responses.

= 1.20.0 =

* **Header notices moved to Tools**, at *WPCredits Program → Tools → Header notices*, and
  each notice now has a **WordPress editor** - links, images, lists, emphasis, a
  subheading. Writing a notice is something somebody sits down and does, which is what the
  Tools section is for; the Settings screen is the program's plumbing and nobody visits it
  to talk to students. It also gives four notices room for an editor, which a settings-table
  row does not have.
* Only the screen moved. The notices still live in the same shared option, so nothing
  needed migrating and anything already written is where it was.
* `wp_kses_post()` was already the filter, so images and links needed no change to survive
  - but the front end did: an uploaded image is whatever size it was uploaded at, and a
  full-width screenshot would have turned a one-line notice into a page. Images are capped,
  and lists, headings and blockquotes are styled for a band a few lines tall.
* Two things the tests caught while writing this. The editor was configured `teeny` *and*
  given a toolbar, which cancels both the toolbar and the media button - so images could not
  have been inserted at all. And the notices test had been asserting its own `wp_kses_post`
  stub rather than WordPress's tag list, reporting that images were stripped when they are
  not; the stub now mirrors the post context, and a separate assertion pins the filter the
  plugin actually calls so nobody narrows it later.

= 1.19.1 =
* **Fixed: "That call is canceled and the slot is free again" never went away.** Outcome
  messages traveled as a query argument - `?wpcpm_call=canceled` - so the argument stayed
  in the address bar and the message came back on every reload, and for anyone the URL was
  shared with. On both dashboards, as reported.
* They are **one-shot messages** now: queued for the user, read and deleted by the page the
  redirect lands on, gone from the next one. The same defect was in three more places and
  all four are converted - saving availability, adding or deleting a note, and saving the
  student's own details. Which mentor or student a manager is inspecting stays in the URL,
  because that is a description of the page and *should* survive a reload.
* The Airtable error detail moves into the message too. It used to be url-encoded into the
  address bar, which made for a URL a screen wide as well as a stale error that reappeared
  on every reload.
* **New: the student's email on their own Student Report Card**, in My profile, where the
  mentor's view of them already had it. Airtable's value when there is one and the account's
  own otherwise - about three in ten students have no email in the program records. Not
  editable there: it is the account's email, and writing it back to Airtable from this page
  would put the two out of step with no way to tell which is right.
* `php bin/test-flash.php` covers the behavior: shown once, gone on reload, channels
  independent, one user's message invisible to another, and no status argument left in any
  redirect.
* `bin/test-handlers.php` now reads the plugin's require list from the bootstrap instead of
  keeping its own copy. The copy had already drifted - adding the message store broke every
  handler test with "Class not found" until it was noticed.

= 1.19.0 =
* **New: header notices, one per audience.** Students, Mentors, Institutions and
  Administrators each get a notice written under **Settings → Header notices**, shown at
  the top of the site to the people it is for and to nobody else. See *Header notices*
  above.
* Somebody in two audiences sees both, in audience order. Withholding one from a person who
  holds two roles would hide it from the group likeliest to need it.
* Rendered on `wp_body_open` so it works under any theme, with
  `wpcpm_notices_auto_render` to take the placement over. The stylesheet is registered
  always and enqueued only when a notice will actually appear, because `wp_body_open` fires
  after `wp_head` and is far too late to ask for one.
* `php bin/test-notices.php` asserts the targeting across all seven combinations of
  audience, plus that an empty notice is off, that a logged-out visitor sees nothing, and
  that a script tag never reaches the database while a link survives. That last pair is the
  reason notices are filtered on save and not only on output.

= 1.18.1 =
* **My mentor call spans the card**, like My course and report form, instead of sitting in
  the page's right-hand column under the mentor. A month grid wants more width than half a
  card gives it - that column was the reason the calendar squares were as small as they
  were.
* Inside the section it now splits into two of its own: **booked calls on the left, the
  picker on the right** - the calendar, its slots and the timezone control. They answer
  different questions ("when am I speaking to my mentor" and "when could I"), and the one
  that needs room now has it. Back to a single column at 900px, with the divider becoming a
  rule above.
* A student with nothing booked gets *Nothing booked yet* in the left column rather than an
  empty half.
* Four paths through that section finish early - no mentor linked, not bookable, nothing
  open, or a full calendar - and each is now two `<div>`s deep. They share one closing
  helper rather than each closing by hand, because the one that eventually forgets would
  pull the whole card apart.

= 1.18.0 =
* **Pressing a time slot now shows that it is working.** It used to look like nothing had
  happened until the page came back, so students pressed again - and a second press can
  hit the booking lock and be told *"another booking was going through at the same
  moment"*, when their own first press was what was going through. The pressed slot reads
  **Booking…**, the other slots step back, a line under them says *Booking your call - one
  moment*, and a repeat press is swallowed rather than posted.
* The same guard covers every form on the two dashboards: canceling a call, saving
  availability, changing timezone, and the student's inline detail edits.
* One trap worth recording, because getting it wrong would have been much worse than the
  problem being fixed: **a disabled control is not submitted**, and the slot buttons carry
  the value being submitted (`name="start"`). Disabling the pressed button inside the
  submit handler would have posted the form with no slot in it and broken booking outright.
  The pressed button is therefore disabled from a deferred callback, after the browser has
  built the request; only the buttons that carry nothing are disabled immediately.
  `php bin/test-submit-guard.php` asserts exactly that, so it cannot be quietly undone.
* Going back to a booking page from the browser's cache clears the busy state, rather than
  restoring a page where every slot is disabled and one still reads "Booking…".
* All of this is a progressive enhancement: with no JavaScript the form posts as it always
  did, and nothing on screen claims otherwise.

= 1.17.2 =
* **Your availability for calls is now closed unconditionally** - at rest, with nothing
  set, and after a save. 1.15.1 closed the first two but kept it opening on save, because
  the confirmation was rendered inside the panel and a shut panel would have swallowed it.
  The confirmation moved outside the disclosure, so it reads with the panel closed and the
  panel no longer has a reason to spring open at all.

= 1.17.1 =
* **Fixed a fatal error on every booking, cancellation and timezone change.** The redirect
  at the end of those handlers used `self::ANCHOR`, but that constant belongs to
  `WPCPM_Call_Calendar`, not `WPCPM_Mentor_Calls` - so the request died with *Undefined
  constant* instead of returning to the calendar. Present from 1.13.1; **anyone on 1.13.1
  to 1.17.0 should update.** No data was lost: the booking itself was written before the
  redirect, so calls made during that window exist and appear on both dashboards.
* Two checks added under `bin/`, because `php -l` cannot catch this and nothing here was
  executing the handlers:
  * `php bin/check-references.php` - resolves every `self::` and `WPCPM_X::` reference
    against what the class actually declares. An undefined class constant is a runtime
    fatal, so it parses cleanly and then takes the site down on the one request that
    reaches it. 1166 references checked.
  * `php bin/test-handlers.php` - runs every `admin-post` handler against stubbed
    WordPress and fails on a PHP `Error`. A redirect or a `wp_die()` is a pass; both are
    normal. Confirmed to fail on the bug above and pass with it fixed.

= 1.17.0 =
* **Copy hours between days** in the availability editor's Weekly hours: pick a day, pick
  *every day*, *weekdays* or *the weekend*, press Copy. It fills the form in; it does not
  save. The mentor still presses **Save availability**, which means a copy that went to the
  wrong days is undone by not saving - a better escape hatch than an undo button.
* Copying a day with no hours in it is **refused**, with a line saying so. Copying blanks
  across the week is a fair reading of "copy" and a destructive surprise; a mentor reaching
  for this wants to fill days in. Days are still cleared one at a time by hand.
* A half-filled window - a start with no end - is not treated as empty, and copies as it
  stands. The form already tolerates a half-finished row and drops it on save.
* The control is scripted and has nothing to degrade to, so it is rendered hidden and
  unhidden by the script: nobody is shown a button that would do nothing. This is also why
  the calendar script now loads on the mentor page, where its other job - offering the
  browser's timezone - simply finds nothing to do.

= 1.16.2 =
* The page is **Student Report Card**, and the section holding the student's own photo,
  name and details is **My profile**. The toolbar and menu items that point at the page
  follow its title.
* Existing pages are renamed automatically. This is the third title this page has had, and
  the revision counter added in 1.16.0 is what makes it a one-line change: a site on any
  earlier revision converges on the current title exactly once, and a page renamed by hand
  is still left alone.

= 1.16.1 =
* The student's photo and name moved **inside the My program section**, under its heading
  and above its table - built with the same three-element shape as the mentor card in the
  column beside it, so the two columns are a pair rather than merely similar.
* Two things follow from that, and both are changes from how it looked as a page header:
  the portrait is **88px**, matching the mentor's, and the name takes the mentor name's
  type rather than 22px. At page-header size inside a column the left column shouts while
  the right one whispers. Say the word if you want either back.
* The name is a paragraph, not an `<h2>`. It sits inside the section whose `<h3>` is
  directly above it, so the heading it used to be nested a higher outline level inside a
  lower one - an outline error rather than a styling preference.
* The section renders unconditionally now, because it owns the identity card. A student
  waiting on their first sync used to get a page with nobody on it; they now get their own
  name and photo, and a notice where the table would be rather than ten rows of "Not set".

= 1.16.0 =
* The student page is **My Profile**, and its sections are first person: **My program**,
  **My mentor**, **My mentor call**. Only the first of those was asked for; the other two
  follow because "My program" beside "Your mentor" in one card reads as an unfinished edit
  rather than a choice. Each is one string if you want it back.
* **New section: My course and report form**, below the two columns, holding a button to
  the Learn WordPress course for the student's track and the report-form button that used
  to sit under the program table. Those are the only two *actions* on the page -
  everything above them is reference - and a button at the foot of one column reads as
  belonging to that column rather than to the page. The section renders nothing at all
  when neither link exists.
* **Fixed a flaw in the page-rename migration.** It recorded a boolean, so an install that
  had already been renamed once was skipped for ever and would have kept a title two
  revisions old. It records a revision number now, so each rename runs exactly once
  however many there have been - and every past title is listed, so a site on any earlier
  revision converges on the current one. A page renamed by hand is still left alone.

= 1.15.2 =
* The contribution team's icon **labels the row** - before the words "Contribution team",
  where every other row's icon is - instead of sitting in the value beside each team name.
* **A question mark labels the row when no team has been chosen.** That is a different
  fact from an empty value, and the one a mentor scanning a list of students is looking
  for, so it stays at full strength where the other icons dim on an empty row.
* A team that is set but not in the icon map gets a neutral team glyph rather than a
  question mark - one *has* been chosen, and a question mark would say otherwise.
* **Mentors' team badges have no icons.** They share the same renderer as the student's
  team value, and that renderer is back to plain linked names.
* A student on more than one team takes the first recognized one for the label. The label
  has room for one; the value lists them all.

= 1.15.1 =
* **Your availability for calls** starts closed, whether or not anything is set. It used
  to unfold itself for a mentor who had set nothing, on the theory that an empty schedule
  is a job to do - but it sits beside the diary now, and a form that opens on arrival
  every time is a form that has to be closed every time. It still opens after a save,
  because the confirmation renders inside it.
* An empty schedule says so in `#daa39b` rather than the same gray as the rest of the
  supporting text. With the panel closed by default that summary line is the only thing
  that will tell a mentor they are not receiving calls, so it stops reading as a footnote.
  Set on `--wpcpm-attention`, so a theme can restate it in one place.

= 1.15.0 =
* **Contribution teams carry their team icon**, on both dashboards, sized and colored to
  sit with the contact-row icons rather than at the 20px Dashicons ships at.
* These are **Dashicons**, WordPress's own set - *not* icons from make.wordpress.org,
  which does not publish any. Its team list is plain headings, every team site serves the
  same generic WordPress favicon, and the team badges on a wordpress.org profile are text
  chips. So the mapping is authored here, from the icons WordPress itself uses in wp-admin
  for these concepts. GPL like this plugin, and every slug was checked against the shipped
  `dashicons.min.css` - a slug that does not exist renders as a blank box, which is the
  kind of thing nobody notices until a screenshot. Filter:
  `wpcpm_contribution_team_icons`.
* All 25 contribution areas in Airtable get an icon, including the seven that have no
  make.wordpress.org page - BuddyPress, bbPress, GlotPress, Mobile, Tide, Data Liberation
  and DEIB. Those stay unlinked, as before, but are no longer bare text.
* `dashicons` is declared as a dependency of the dashboard stylesheet rather than
  enqueued at each render site, so it cannot be forgotten at one.

= 1.14.3 =
* Shortened the **WordPress.org profile** row label to **WordPress.org**, matching the
  other contact rows, which name the service rather than the kind of page. Applied on
  both dashboards, in the student's own editor, and to the matching column on the Mentor
  Status Checker screen so the two do not disagree.

= 1.14.2 =
* **Edit** now sits at the right edge of the table rather than beside the value: the
  value takes whatever width is left. Opened, the form spans the cell so its fields read
  left to right like any other form.
* Renamed "Slack name" to **Slack**.
* The contact rows carry small icons - Email, Slack, WordPress.org, Website,
  GitHub, and the internship dates - on both the mentor's student details and the
  student's own two tables. They are drawn from primitives and stroked in
  `currentColor`, so they take the color of the text beside them and cannot come out
  wrong in a theme nobody has seen. None is a brand mark: Slack gets a channel hash,
  GitHub gets code brackets. Shipping a service's own logo would mean redistributing a
  trademark, which this does not need to do.
* The icons are echoed rather than passed through `wp_kses()`, deliberately: every byte
  is a static array in `WPCPM_Icons`, and kses lowercases attribute names - SVG is
  case-sensitive, so `viewBox` would come back as `viewbox` and every icon would lose
  its scaling.

= 1.14.1 =
* **Editing moved into the table.** The four details a student maintains are now edited
  where they are shown: each row in *Your program* carries an **Edit** link that opens a
  one-field form beside the current value. The separate "Your details" section is gone.
  One small form per field rather than one for all four - a save touches only the field
  that was edited, where a single form rewrote all four every time and turned a typo in
  one into a rewrite of the others.
* **Fixed: the student's name and photo appeared at the foot of the page**, under the
  administrator's "view as" control. The two-column grid was declared on the dashboard
  root, so the identity header and that control were unplaced children competing with
  explicitly-placed sections - grid put them in the first *free* row, which was below
  both. The two-column region now has a container of its own, which also means anything
  added to the page later cannot land in the grid by accident.
* **Fixed: the mentor's contact table was indented** under their name instead of lining
  up with their photo. It was inside the card's text column; it is a sibling of the whole
  card now, so it starts at the same left edge the portrait does.
* **The existing page gets renamed.** `ensure_page()` only sets a title when it *creates*
  the page, so 1.14.0's switch to American spelling left "My Programme" on every install
  that already had one. A one-time migration renames it, and only if the title is still
  the one this plugin set - a page renamed by hand is left alone. The slug is untouched.
* The mentor's own contribution teams link to their team sites too, matching the
  student's.

= 1.14.0 =
* **American English throughout**, in the interface and in the code's own comments. "Programme" is "Program" everywhere, including the student page's title and the *My Program* menu item, along with the other British spellings the codebase had picked up.
  *One thing this does not change:* the student page's stored title. `ensure_page()` only sets a title when it creates the page, so an existing install keeps "My Programme" until it is renamed under **Pages**. The slug is `student-dashboard` and is untouched, so nothing breaks either way. Identifiers, database keys and query values were deliberately left alone - `_wpcpm_call_cancelled_by` names live data, and renaming it would orphan every canceled booking on disk.
* **Students maintain four of their own details**, and the changes go back to Airtable: WordPress.org profile, Slack name, contribution team and personal website. Airtable is written first and the local cache updated only if that succeeded - the other order would show a student their change and then lose it on the next sync, which is worse than refusing the save. Contribution team is a *linked-record* field in Airtable, so it is a select of the teams the sync has cataloged rather than a text box; an unknown value is refused rather than written. Needs `data.records:write` on the token.
* Airtable's `In Sensei` and `In Sensei 50h` are shown as **WordPress Credits Program 150h** and **WordPress Credits Program 50h** everywhere, with a link to that track's Learn WordPress course. The raw values stay the storage format - the sync still matches on them and the settings still list them. Filters: `wpcpm_program_labels`, `wpcpm_program_courses`.
* **Contribution team names link to their team site.** The list is *read from* the Contributor Team Matcher plugin when it is installed, rather than copied, so it cannot go stale; a bundled fallback covers a site without it. Airtable's list is longer than the matcher's, and a team with no known page stays plain text - guessing a URL from a team name is how somebody ends up linked to a 404. Filter: `wpcpm_contribution_team_links`.
* **Two new fields from the Students table**: *Field of study* on both dashboards, and *Accessibility needs* on the mentor's side only - it is the one field there a mentor may need to act on before a call. Both are joined by email, the same way the tutor already is, because neither exists in Students Reports. **Run one sync after updating** for them to appear.
* Renamed: "Main contribution team" → **Contribution team**, "Internship" → **Internship duration**.
* The mentor dashboard shows **the mentor's name as the page heading**, with the student count and last-updated on one line beneath it. The page's own "My Students" title is gone - it said less than the name does. *Upcoming calls* and *Your availability for calls* now sit side by side.
* The student page leads with a larger portrait and their name, and drops the "Program: In Sensei" line under it - the program is the first row of the table directly below. The mentor's photo is larger too, and booking a call now sits directly under the mentor card, which is what names the person the call is with.
* Matching theme update (WPCredits theme 1.6.0), which also fixes the student page's profile photos: they had their own brand-colored border instead of the site's shared photo mount, which is why they did not look like any other photo on the site.

= 1.13.1 =
Cross-check against the WPCredits theme, plus a hardening pass over the calendar.

* **Fixed: uninstall crashed and cleaned up nothing.** `uninstall.php` builds its own
  dependency list rather than booting the plugin, and 1.13.0 taught the Mentors module to
  call the three new calendar classes without adding them to that list - a fatal in the
  middle of cleanup, which leaves every option, role and record behind and says nothing
  about it.
* Uninstall now also clears the **students** sync cron, which it never did - the mentors
  hooks were cleared and the students ones were not, and a scheduled hook whose callback
  no longer exists fails silently forever. And it sweeps the prefix-named leftovers that
  cannot be removed by listing keys: cached WordPress.org profile reads, booking locks
  from requests that died holding one, and the per-student resolved-mentor cache.

* **New public API: `WPCPM_Mentors_Dashboard::current_mentor()`.** Which mentor's list a
  request is showing was private, so the theme reimplemented it - and the copy tested for
  the Mentor *role*, which an administrator who also mentors never holds, since the sync
  refuses to touch an administrator's roles. The page and the theme's data therefore
  described different mentors. Exposing the real answer removes the duplicate. Anything
  dressing this page should call it rather than guess.
* **Fixed: a student could exceed the bookings-per-student limit by racing.** The limit
  was checked before the booking lock was taken, so two requests could both see zero
  upcoming calls and then book different slots in turn. It is now re-checked inside the
  lock. The slot re-check did not catch this, because the two requests were not competing
  for the same slot.
* **Fixed: paging the calendar dropped a program manager's student view.** The month and
  day links preserved `wpcpm_student`, which is the notes focus on the mentor page and
  holds an Airtable record ID, while the argument that actually selects a student -
  `wpcpm_student_view` - was discarded. Booking and canceling now keep it too.
* Hardened: every value in the availability form is read as a scalar, so a posted array
  can no longer become the literal string "Array" in a schedule; and the names that reach
  a mail *subject* are stripped of the newlines that would turn one into extra headers.
  Both come from outside this code - an Airtable column and a WordPress profile.
* Documented: the `wpcpm_slack_url` filter is now the only place the Slack target is set.
  The theme used to link the handle as well and has dropped its own filter.

= 1.13.0 =
* **New: a call calendar for the Mentors module.** A mentor sets their weekly availability on their own dashboard; the students assigned to them pick a date and time from it. See *Call calendar* above for the whole feature.
* A mentor's hours are stored in the mentor's timezone and shown to everybody on their own, chosen once and remembered - a program running across a dozen countries has no single right clock. Daylight saving is handled: nothing is offered in an hour the clocks skip, and a wall-clock time in a repeated hour is offered once.
* Double-booking is prevented at the database, not in the interface: a short lock, a re-check of the slot inside it, and a clash check on the table afterward that undoes the later of two bookings.
* Booking and canceling both email the other person. Filter `wpcpm_send_call_mail` to stop that.
* Filter `wpcpm_availability_defaults` sets the program-wide starting point for call length, notice, horizon and bookings per student. Availability itself is deliberately empty until a mentor sets it - a default nine-to-five nobody chose would still take bookings.
* Matching theme update (WPCredits theme 1.5.0), which dresses the calendar, the diary and the availability editor in the dashboard's own grays and control shapes. Without it the calendar works but is styled by the plugin's theme-agnostic fallback.

= 1.12.0 =
* Administrators now get every dashboard in one **Dashboards** toolbar menu - *Student Dashboard* and *Mentor Dashboard* together - instead of separate top-level items. Anyone with a single page still gets a direct link rather than a menu wrapped around one destination, and someone who is both a mentor and a student gets both, labeled as their own.
* Fixed: an administrator opening a dashboard before anything had been synced was told "your account does not hold the Mentor role" - untrue, and no help. They now get the real reason, that no accounts have been synced yet, and a link to the screen that fixes it.

= 1.11.1 =
* The student page now matches the mentor page's layout. Its stylesheet depends on the mentor one and the two share the shell - identity header, "view as" switcher, muted text, avatars, badges and buttons - so a single definition serves both and they cannot drift apart. Detail tables use the same label column and spacing.
* Matching theme update (WPCredits theme 1.4.0): the student page gets the same card, the same 32px insets and the same grays and type as the mentor page, its own template, and a **My Program** link in the header.

= 1.11.0 =
* **The Students module is built.** Student accounts are provisioned from Airtable, hold the Student role, and can read Student-level content only.
* Added the *My Program* page at `/student-dashboard/`, gated to Student level: program, internship dates, tutor, institution, WordPress.org profile, Slack name, contribution team, personal website, and a button to the student's prefilled report form.
* The page shows the mentor assigned to the student with their contact details. Airtable holds only a mentor's name, email and profile URL, so their Slack handle, job line, location, website, GitHub and teams are read from their WordPress.org profile - cached for twelve hours and shared across that mentor's students.
* Usernames come from a student's WordPress.org profile where Airtable has one, and from their email address otherwise.
* Students land on their page at login and in place of the wp-admin Dashboard, with a *My Program* toolbar link. Same exceptions as the mentor side.
* Added a `wpcpm_slack_url` link for student and mentor Slack handles alike, and a `wpcpm_field_descriptions`-style separation so nothing new was hardcoded.

= 1.10.1 =
* The Slack name is now a link to the program's Slack channel, <code>https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C0959D2M3T8</code>. Slack has no public per-user URL, so every handle points at the channel where a mentor would use it. Override with the `wpcpm_slack_url` filter.
* A student with no Slack handle still shows "Not set" rather than an empty link.
* The WPCredits theme was linking the handle to make.wordpress.org/chat itself; it now takes the plugin's target so the two cannot disagree (theme 1.3.3).

= 1.10.0 =
* Administrators who are also Active mentors in Airtable now see **their own** current and past students on the mentor page. The sync deliberately never gives an administrator the Mentor role, so a role check alone treated them as a non-mentor and showed them the first mentor in the list instead.
* Such an administrator now also appears in the *Viewing as mentor* switcher, so they can inspect a colleague and switch back to themselves. Previously the switcher rejected their own ID.
* Renamed the **Mentor page** link to **Mentor Dashboard**. Anyone with a list of their own - administrators who mentor included - still sees it labeled **My Students**.

= 1.9.0 =
* Removed the **Description** column from the student details table, and the Field/Value header row with it - two columns of label and value need no headings to explain them.
* The Airtable source line under each description went with the column. Field descriptions are still read from Airtable and still available through the `wpcpm_field_descriptions` filter; nothing on the page uses them now.
* Matching theme update (WPCredits theme 1.2.1): the rules for the removed header and description column are gone, and the label column width moved from the header row onto the body, where it now lives.

= 1.8.1 =
* Past students can no longer be given new notes - a graduated student is not going to be called again. The form is hidden for them and the request is refused server-side, not just hidden. Existing history stays readable and deletable.
* Spaced out the **Currently mentoring** and **Past students** headings, so the count no longer sits flush against the label and the heading keeps clear of the cards below it.

= 1.8.0 =
* The My Students page is now split into **Currently mentoring** and **Past students**, the latter in its own collapsed section.
* Past students are read from Airtable for the first time - previously only `In Sensei` and `In Sensei 50h` were fetched, so finished students were not in the data at all. **Run one sync after updating** for the Past section to appear.
* Which section a student falls into comes from their Airtable status, not their end date, and both status lists are editable in the settings. A status listed in both counts as current.
* Current students are ordered by soonest deadline; past students by most recently finished.
* The Mentors admin screen gained a **Past** column, and the sync report now counts current and past reports separately.
* Expand all now also opens the Past students section.

= 1.7.3 =
* Fixed: the **Program access** panel forced a horizontal scrollbar on the editor sidebar. Two causes. The plugin's admin stylesheet is only loaded on its own screens, so the editor got no styling for the control at all; and a select is sized from its widest option and will not shrink below it without `min-width: 0`, which `widefat` does not set.
* Added a small editor stylesheet, loaded on the post editor only.
* The "Public - everyone" option now reads "Public", with the explanation moved to the description under the control.

= 1.7.2 =
* Reverted the 1.7.1 change: the **Student report form** button is inside the student's card again, visible once the card is opened, rather than in an always-visible footer row.
* The empty-`id` fix from 1.7.1 is kept - it was an unrelated correctness fix, not part of the reverted behavior.

= 1.7.1 =
* The **Student report form** button is now visible on a collapsed student, not only once the card is opened.
* It sits outside the disclosure rather than inside the clickable summary row: a link nested in a summary is an accessibility trap, where activating it can toggle the disclosure instead of following the link.
* Fixed: a student row with no Airtable record ID rendered an empty `id` attribute, which repeated on every such card.

= 1.7.0 =
* Added call notes. Each student now has a running history of notes - one per call, typically - written and read on their own card, each stamped with date, time and author. The collapsed row shows a note count.
* A mentor can delete their own notes; a program manager can delete any. Nobody can delete a colleague's note.
* Notes are only visible to mentors that student is assigned to, plus administrators. Every read and write is checked against the mentor's own synced student list.
* Stored in a private post type rather than with the cached student data, which the sync rewrites in full on every run - a note kept there would not survive the next sync. Notes are never written back to Airtable.
* Saving a note returns to that student's card with it already open, without relying on JavaScript.

= 1.6.0 =
* Added the student's **email address** to their details, as a `mailto:` link so a mentor can write to them in one click. It sits with Slack name, since both answer "how do I reach them".
* The email was already being read from Airtable for the Gravatar fallback, so this needs no re-sync - existing student lists show it immediately.
* `mailto:` links no longer carry `target="_blank"`, which would leave an empty tab behind once the mail client takes over. External links are unchanged.

= 1.5.1 =
* Renamed the **Open personal link** button to **Student report form**. The 50-hour track's button reads **Student report form (50h)**, so the pair stays consistent.
* The button's tooltip no longer runs the Airtable column name through translation - it names the actual column to go and edit, which does not change with locale.

= 1.5.0 =
* Each student's details table is now collapsible and starts collapsed, so a mentor with dozens of students gets a list they can scan. The collapsed row still shows photo, name, status, institution and internship end date.
* Built on a native disclosure element, so it works without JavaScript, from the keyboard, and with screen readers.
* Added **Expand all** and **Collapse all** above the list, shown only when scripting is available.
* Printing opens every student first, then restores what was open, so a printed list is never half-empty.
* A mentor with exactly one student sees that student already open.

= 1.4.0 =
* The *My Students* page is now the mentor's dashboard. Mentors land there when they log in, it replaces the wp-admin Dashboard for them, and a **My Students** link sits in the toolbar so they can return from anywhere. Previously a mentor could log in and have no route to their own page at all.
* A mentor sent through the login form from a specific link still arrives at that link, not the dashboard. `profile.php` stays reachable so they can change their password. Accounts that also hold an editor or author role are never redirected, and administrators are unaffected.
* Controlled by **Mentor landing page** in the settings, on by default.
* Fixed: `page_url()` returned a link to the mentor page even when it was in the trash, because `get_post_status()` returns `trash` rather than nothing. It now requires the page to be published - which matters much more now that logging in depends on it.

= 1.3.3 =
* Fixed: **Educational institution** showed "Confirmed" and **Main contribution team** showed a list of student names. Resolving a record ID to a name read every column and took the first text value it found, on the assumption that a table's primary column is returned first. It is not - that picked Institutions → *Current Stage* and Contribution areas → *Students Reports copy*. The primary column is now identified from Airtable's schema and requested by name, which is also a much smaller request.
* Lookup maps written by the previous version held those wrong values, so they are version-stamped and discarded on upgrade. Until you run a sync the two fields read "Not set" and the Mentors screen asks for one - the plugin will not show a name it cannot stand behind.
* A name column that returns nothing is now reported in the sync warnings instead of silently producing an empty map.
* The Institutions and Contribution areas tables, and the column each uses for its name, are now editable on the settings screen.

= 1.3.2 =
* The settings screen now lists the token scopes and what each is for, instead of mentioning only `data.records:read`. The Mentor Status Checker needs **both** `data.records:read` and `data.records:write` to promote a mentor.
* A permissions error from Airtable now names the scope that is missing - write, schema or read - depending on what the request was, rather than passing Airtable's generic message through.

= 1.3.1 =
* Fixed: **Educational institution** and **Main contribution team** still showed raw record IDs after 1.3.0. Two reasons. The mentor page renders student rows cached in user meta, so resolving them only at sync time left every already-stored row unchanged until someone happened to re-sync; and the ID → name maps were held in the sync state, which is deleted when a run finishes, so nothing was left to resolve with afterward. The maps are now stored in their own option, and the page resolves record IDs as it renders - so existing rows are corrected immediately.
* A record ID that cannot be resolved is left blank rather than printed, so a raw `rec…` never reaches the page.
* The Mentors screen now says when institution and team names have not been read yet, and that a sync will fill them in.

= 1.3.0 =
* Added a **Tools** section, separate from the four modules.
* The standalone **Credits Program Mentor Checker** plugin is now the **Mentor Status Checker** tool. It uses the plugin's shared Airtable connection and settings screen instead of its own. Deactivate the standalone plugin - the tool warns you if it is still active.
* Airtable client gained write support (`data.records:write`), used only to promote a mentor's status.
* Fixed: **Educational institution** and **Main contribution team** showed raw Airtable record IDs such as `recGzpWO43cQnVYEw` instead of names. The REST API returns linked-record fields as bare record IDs, so the sync now reads the Institutions and Contribution areas tables and resolves them. An ID with no matching name is shown as "Not set" rather than printed raw.
* Fixed: the mentor page could render unreadable light-on-light text. Colors were set behind `prefers-color-scheme`, which follows the operating system rather than the theme, so a light theme on a dark-mode machine got near-white muted text on white. Everything is now derived from the theme's own text color.
* `wp wpcredits check-mentors [--promote]` added, with per-mentor progress output.

= 1.2.0 =
* Student details are now laid out as a table with Field, Value and Description columns.
* Field descriptions are read from Airtable itself, via the schema endpoint, so a description written on a column in Airtable appears on the mentor page after the next sync. Built-in descriptions are used until then, and if the token lacks the optional `schema.bases:read` scope.
* Added a `wpcpm_field_descriptions` filter for overriding the built-in descriptions.
* The Airtable source is shown as visible text under each description instead of only as a tooltip.
* Fixed: a description written on the Students `Tutor ` column was never found, because the column name has a trailing space and was matched exactly. Names are now compared trimmed.
* Fixed: a scheme-less URL in Airtable's *Personal Website URL* column linked to a path on this site. Missing schemes are normalized to `https://`.
* Student cards are now full width, since a three-column table does not fit a narrow card, and the table stacks on small screens.

= 1.1.0 =
* Mentor page now shows profile photos - the mentor's own in the page header, and each student's on their card - taken from their WordPress.org profile, with a Gravatar fallback for anyone who has no profile recorded.
* Every field label now carries a tooltip naming the Airtable table and column the value came from, so it is clear where each piece of data originates.
* Empty fields are no longer hidden. A blank value shows a muted "Not set" with a tooltip, so a gap in Airtable is visible as a gap instead of the row silently vanishing - this is what made a missing Educational institution look like a bug in the page.
* Syncs now always show live progress: a progress bar, step counter, running record counts and a per-second elapsed clock.
* Starting a sync no longer blocks the request that started it - previously the click could hang for up to 18 seconds with nothing on screen.
* The admin screen drives the run as it polls, so a sync progresses even where WP-Cron is unreliable; cron stays as a fallback for a closed tab.
* Added a database-level lock so a browser-driven tick and a cron tick can never process the same Airtable page twice.
* A run that stops advancing for more than two minutes is now reported as stalled instead of spinning indefinitely.
* `wp wpcredits sync-mentors` prints percentage and live counts, one line per slice.
* Mentee counts are stored as their own user meta, so the admin list no longer unserializes every mentor's full student array to render a count.

= 1.0.0 =
* Initial release.
* Four-module structure: Students, Mentors, Institutions, Administrators.
* Student, Mentor and Institution roles based on Subscriber, each with its own content-access capability; program capabilities granted to Administrator.
* Per-post access levels enforced on listings, direct access, rendered content and the REST API.
* Mentors module: Airtable sync provisioning Mentor accounts from WordPress.org usernames, collision-safe account matching, opt-in invitation emails, and role revocation when a mentor stops being Active.
* Mentors module: *My Students* page listing each mentor's assigned `In Sensei` and `In Sensei 50h` students, as a block and the `[wpcpm_mentor_dashboard]` shortcode.
* WP-CLI: `wp wpcredits sync-mentors [--dry-run]`, `wp wpcredits mentor <mentor>`, `wp wpcredits roles`.
