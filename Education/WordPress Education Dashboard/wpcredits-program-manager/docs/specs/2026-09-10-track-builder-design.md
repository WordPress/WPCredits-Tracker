# Track Builder

**Date:** 10 September 2026
**Component:** `wpcredits-program-manager` 1.99.2, ships in five phases (T1 to T5) from 1.100.0. `version_compare()` orders 1.100.0 after 1.99.2; a string sort would not, which is why this line says so. No `wpcredits-theme` release is needed in any phase (decision 3.10).
**Status:** approved by the product owner on 10 September 2026, after design sessions on 7, 8 and 10 September. Phase T1 shipped as 1.100.0 on 11 September 2026 (`docs/plans/2026-09-10-track-builder-t1.md`); phase T2a is planned in `docs/plans/2026-09-11-track-builder-t2a.md`.
**Depends on:** the Developer Track design of 26 August 2026 and the Designer Track design of 7 September 2026. Their shape - a track is an Airtable `Status` value, one map entry per track, nothing stored per student - is what this module turns into data. It proposes one change to the Learn Link design of 7 September 2026 (section 9).

House rules that apply to every line below: comments explain why and name the decision behind a rule; no em dashes; full product names ("Student Report Card", "Mentor Report Card", "Administrator Dashboard"); US English in every string a person reads; every behavior worth trusting has an assertion in `bin/test-*.php`; `bin/` and `docs/` never ship but are public on the mirror, and `includes/` ships, so nothing personal enters any of them.

Adding a program track is a plugin release today. The Designer Track (1.98.2 to 1.99.2) touched the program map, the Student Report Card form, the settings upgrade, two stylesheets, the fixtures and the guides, and Airtable gained a `Status` choice on two tables, twenty-one columns and two automation changes made by hand. This module lets a Program Administrator do the site's half on the site: create a track (blank, duplicated from another, or started from its Learn course), edit its Student Report Card form question by question, and publish it, with the site creating the Airtable columns the form needs. The four tracks that exist move into the same format, and their hand-written code is deleted only when the product owner says so.

Program Administrators are WordPress Administrators: the plugin grants that role every marker capability plus `wpcpm_manage_program` (`WPCPM_Roles::administrator_caps()`), and every screen below is gated on that capability, like every other wp-admin screen of the plugin.

---

## 1. Settled by the product owner

1. **Program Administrators create new tracks and edit existing ones on the site, and Airtable is kept in step** (7 September 2026, the request).
2. **A track is a post of a private post type. A draft touches nothing; publishing is the one act that writes to Airtable** (7 September 2026, approach A of three).
3. **The site creates the Airtable columns itself**, rather than mapping onto columns somebody made by hand (7 September 2026).
4. **Full parity with the hand-written forms:** every property and control the four tracks use can be authored, rather than a set of lesson templates (7 September 2026).
5. **The four existing tracks move into definitions, and their PHP is deleted only once the new path is confirmed working and the product owner says it can be removed** (7 September 2026).
6. **The module is called Track Builder** (10 September 2026). It was proposed as Track Designer, one word order away from the Designer Track; the product owner kept that name on 7 September 2026 and chose Track Builder on 10 September, so "Designer" on this site names one track and nothing else.
7. **A new track can be duplicated from an existing one** (8 September 2026, flagged important). Columns are shared by default. Rewording a shared question warns and names every other track that writes that column; changing its control, its Airtable type or a select's options gives it a new column of its own, automatically and said in place.
8. **A track connects to a specific Learn course by its link**, as every current track does (8 September 2026).
9. **A track need not count hours** (8 September 2026). A missing target means no target, exactly like the Developer Track's 0, and nothing may require one. `WPCPM_Program::hours_targets()` already says so in its docblock.
10. **A new track reaches the institution import and institution create only once its reports automation includes it** (11 September 2026). Until somebody ticks checklist item 1 (7.3), the institution import form and institution create do not offer a Track Builder track: a student put on it before the automation names its status never gets a report row (2.4). The four built-in tracks are unaffected.
11. **A new track starts as a duplicate in T2b, and is published in T2c** (12 September 2026). New track, blank or from a Learn course, and the question editor stay in T3, so the first tracks a Program Administrator makes on the screen are duplicates of tracks that already exist, whose columns the base already has.
12. **A built-in draft is refreshed from the seed the plugin ships** (12 September 2026). A site rebuilds every built-in draft it has never published when the shipped `SEED_VERSION` is newer than the one the site recorded, and the track list offers Refresh on such a row. Since 1.101.1 the store refuses to save a built-in track, so nothing a person wrote is at stake, and a hand-written form changed in a release no longer leaves that site's switch refused for good.
13. **Publishing a built-in track leaves "Currently mentoring" alone** (12 September 2026). Those four statuses were the program's before the Track Builder existed and are edited in Settings, so publishing a seed never puts back a status a manager took out, and the preflight says so in a line. A track of somebody's own still has its status added, which is what makes its students sync (7.2).
14. **Saving the program settings recompiles** (12 September 2026). The compiled stores and `wpcpm_tracks_skipped` were only as fresh as the last publish, so a status moved out of "Currently mentoring" left a live track running until something unrelated published. Saving now compiles, which corrects both what students see and what the track list reports.
15. **Column creation moves into T2c, and the two `Status` choices never leave the checklist** (12 September 2026, settling open item 1). Airtable's create-field endpoint makes every column a track's questions name, with `schema.bases:write`. Its update-field endpoint changes a field's name, its description and a formula's expression, and cannot add a choice to an existing single select. The one route that can, a record write with `typecast`, is forbidden by 2.5 and unavailable regardless, because the site never writes `Status`. T2c therefore carries the schema token and step 1 of 7.2, and step 3 is checklist item 3 for good.

16. **The schema token is minted for T2c, and the column creation is proven live before it ships** (12 September 2026). The product owner mints a token with `schema.bases:write` and pastes it into the site; nobody else handles it, and it never travels through a chat message or a commit. The first real run happens on a throwaway base created for the purpose and a throwaway WordPress Studio site pointed at it, never `appIzQKfwTn5dyPVp`.
17. **The preflight refuses six things and warns about three** (12 September 2026, fixing 7.1's line). It refuses: a table over 500 fields after publishing, a question bound to a column the syncs own, a computed column (formula, lookup, rollup or count), a link column other than `Main Contribution Team`, a status or key another track already has, and a built-in track whose definition no longer matches its PHP. It warns, and publishing proceeds: past 450 fields, a `Status` choice that is nearly right (differing by case, spacing or an apostrophe), and a Learn course that does not answer. A nearly-right choice warns rather than refuses because the site cannot tell a typo from a deliberate rename, and the person reading the warning can.
18. **A failed run resumes, and nothing rolls back** (12 September 2026). Each step that lands is recorded on the post, so pressing Publish again starts at the first step not recorded, and a name-taken refusal is re-read: a column of that name with the right type counts as landed. There is no control that removes what a failed run created, because deleting anything in Airtable is out of scope (section 14) and a half-made column is visible in the base for a person to judge.
19. **T2c folds in the two findings T2b's whole-branch review parked** (12 September 2026). The track list asked the students sync for a count once per row, and each call scanned every provisioned student, so the screen's cost grew with the roster: one pass now tallies every status at once. The settings recompile hung on `WPCPM_Settings::save()`, which the handbook migration also calls on `init` before the track post type is registered: it moves to the settings screen's own handler, which keeps decision 14 and drops the coupling.
20. **The institution gate of decision 10 covers both flows** (12 September 2026, confirmed). The institution import form and institution create both read `WPCPM_Institutions::automation_statuses()` rather than `WPCPM_Program::labels()`, so neither offers a Track Builder track before its checklist item 1 is ticked.

21. **T3 is three phases** (13 September 2026). T3a is the question editor with its forks and warnings, which is what makes a duplicated track editable and is the gap that matters. T3b is preview, a blank track and history. T3c is the Learn course entry point, the documentation section and what is left. Each is the size T2b and T2c were, each ships something usable on its own, and the one piece with an outside dependency and an open item goes last.
22. **A question is edited on a screen of its own** (13 September 2026, replacing section 6's disclosures). The Designer Track has 49 questions. At roughly twenty properties each, one form for the whole track posts about 980 inputs against PHP's default `max_input_vars` of 1000, and a POST over that ceiling is truncated silently, so saving that track would quietly lose questions. The track's page lists the questions by group and each is edited on its own page, so neither the page nor the POST grows with the track, a refusal redraws one question, and nothing depends on a host's `php.ini`.
23. **A published question's column is locked, so a published question cannot fork** (13 September 2026). Renaming it would leave the old column holding every student's answers while the form began writing to a new one, and decision 9 forbids removing the old one. This is 4.1's rule for `status` and `key` applied per question: free until the question is first published, fixed after. Changing the control of a published question therefore leaves its column alone, and the editor says what to do instead, which is to remove the question and add a new one with a column of its own. The backstop already exists: `judge()` refuses a control whose Airtable type differs from the column in the base.
24. **The editor's column count reads a cached schema; the publish screen never does** (13 September 2026). The line at the top of the editor comes from the same diff the preflight computes, and the preflight reads the base over HTTPS, so drawing it live would put an Airtable round trip in front of every editor page. Every successful schema read now fills a 15-minute transient, the editor's line reads that and says how old the reading is, and the preflight keeps reading fresh. The number that decides what gets created in Airtable is never a cached one.
25. **A track that was never published can be deleted** (13 September 2026). Decision 9 keeps every track that was ever published, because it is the record of what was created in the base. A draft that was never published created no column, holds no student's status and was never compiled into the live stores, so that reason does not reach it, and without a delete a duplicate made by mistake sits in the list beside the real tracks for good. Delete is offered only on a track whose publish log holds no publish, and the confirmation names it. The preflight learns to refuse a trashed track at the same time, which closes the finding T2c's whole-branch review parked for the phase that added a trash control.
26. **A select pointed at an existing single select is refused when a choice is missing** (13 September 2026, a consequence of decision 15). `judge()` compares a column's type and never its choices, which was sound while questions arrived only by duplication and their options came with their column. T3a is the first phase where a question can be pointed at an arbitrary column that already exists, so the comparison is added: a `select` whose options are not all among the column's choices is refused, naming the absent ones and saying that Airtable's API cannot add them. Without it the preflight would pass and the student's save would fail.

## 2. What the code and the base say

Read on 10 September 2026, against 1.99.2 on `main` and the base `appIzQKfwTn5dyPVp`.

### 2.1 A track in the code

A track is its Airtable status. `WPCPM_Program` holds five maps keyed on it: `labels()`, `courses()`, `hours_targets()`, `track()` (the short key: `150h`, `50h`, `dev`, `design`) and `badge()`, which is derived from `track()` (the 150-hour key paints `sensei`; `paused` and `pending` are two states on no track). Three of the maps are filtered already (`wpcpm_program_labels`, `wpcpm_program_courses`, `wpcpm_program_hours_targets`); `track()` is not, and `badge()` follows it.

The Student Report Card form is `WPCPM_Student_Report_Form::fields( $track )` (line 136): about 580 lines building one array per track, with branches for `50h` (line 541), `design` (559) and `dev` (678), and the 150-hour set for any key it does not know. It is filtered at its end (`wpcpm_report_form_fields`, line 719), and nothing hooks that filter yet. Everything downstream reads the array rather than the branches: `render_body()`, `render_hours()`, `handle_save()`, `handle_image_remove()`, `image_columns()` (which the students sync uses to ask Airtable for the screenshot columns by name) and `WPCPM_Semester_Report::link_labels()`. `image_columns()` and `link_labels()` already find the tracks by walking `labels()` and `track()`, so a track that reaches both maps reaches them too.

Four places know the tracks without asking the map:

| Where | What it holds | What an authored track needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WPCPM_Student_Report_Form::fields()` | the three branches | the filter (3.3) |
| `WPCPM_Settings` | the `student_statuses` default and `status_upgrades()` | publishing appends its status (7.2) |
| `WPCPM_Administrators_Cards::TRACKS` and `render_programs()` | the four tiles of the Administrator Dashboard's Programs running card | both derived from the map (T1) |
| `WPCPM_Institutions::AUTOMATION_STATUSES` | the statuses an Airtable automation watches (2.4) | an accessor that adds confirmed tracks (7.3) |

`WPCPM_Mentors_Sync::link_field()` also names three keys, for the legacy Fillout personal links; any other key falls back to the 150-hour link, which nothing displays any more. It needs nothing.

Two behaviors matter more than they look. **The students sync fetches only the statuses in `student_statuses`**, read from the saved option; `maybe_upgrade()` exists because a new value in a list default never reaches a saved option on its own. And **`WPCPM_Students_Sync::revoke_departed()` treats any linked student its run did not read as departed**: the account is marked inactive and, with "When a student is no longer active" set to revoke, loses the Student role. Taking a track's status out of `student_statuses` would do that to every student on the track at the next run.

### 2.2 The four forms as data

A throwaway probe loaded the form with the stubs `bin/test-report-form.php` uses and passed each track's array through `json_encode()` and back:

| Track | Questions | As JSON | Round trip |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 150h | 24 | 3,883 bytes | identical |
| 50h | 11 | 1,859 bytes | identical |
| dev | 31 | 5,225 bytes | identical |
| design | 49 | 7,994 bytes | identical |

`===` held for all four, key order and value types included, with the three column names that carry the typographic apostrophe in `Site’s`. No value is an object or a closure, and nothing in `fields()` reads a setting, a user or the clock. **So a definition can hold exactly what `fields()` returns, and the migration's proof can be `===`.**

The 115 questions use ten controls: number 40, url 28, textarea 23, image 10, text 4, team 4, email 2, checkbox 2, richtext 1, select 1. They are the ten `render_field()` draws; `WPCPM_Field_Value` also validates `date` and `rating`, which this form never draws. The questions use thirteen properties: `label`, `type` and `group` on all 115; `step`, `min` and `max` on the 40 numbers; `help` 29; `row` 25; `lead` 21; `subgroup` 10; `stack` 8; `maxlength` 4; `required`, `options` and `mono` once each. `note` is drawn by `render_body()` and used by none of the four today.

**Sharing is the norm.** The four forms name 53 distinct columns. 28 of them are asked by two or more tracks, and 10 by all four: `Hours`, `WordPress Profile`, `Slack Name`, the grades for open source basics, decision making and conflict resolution, `Personal Website URL`, `Main Contribution Team`, `Contribution Project Summary` and the community meetings question.

### 2.3 Students Reports

`Students Reports` (`tbljYkkVGbeoaWEtY`) has **73 fields**, and Airtable allows **500 per table** on every plan. The 53 form columns are all in `bin/fixtures/reports-table-fields.json`. The other 20 are the record's identity and program columns, plus five columns renamed `(DELETED)`, which is what removing a column looks like in this base. At the Designer Track's twenty-one new columns, 427 fields of headroom is about twenty tracks that share nothing; tracks share more than half their columns, so the real margin is wider, but it is finite and nothing gives it back.

Both `Status` fields carry the tracks as choices, with different choice sets and colors: `Students Reports` has twelve (Developer Track `tealLight2`, Designer Track `pinkLight1`), and the `Students` table, where people set a student's status, has fifteen (its Designer Track is `pinkBright`).

### 2.4 What Airtable does on its own

A track is also two kinds of automation, read with the Airtable connector:

- **`Add students to Students Reports and Feedback`** (`wflXg1xFuiCSG0pXZ`, deployed) creates a student's `Students Reports` row and `Feedback` row once a `Students` row has a name, an email, an institution, a mentor and a `Status` that is one of **five** choices: In Sensei, In Sensei Self-onboarding, In Sensei 50h, Developer Track and Designer Track. It copies the status across by name. **A student on a track this condition does not name never gets a report row, so never appears on the site at all.**
- **Each track has its own welcome email**, triggered by the `Students Reports` `Status`: `Email - [EN] - Student Welcome Email`, `Email - [EN] - 50h Student Welcome Email`, `Email - [EN] - Student Welcome Email - Developer Track` and `Email - [EN] - Design Track Student Welcome Email`, all deployed.

`WPCPM_Institutions::AUTOMATION_STATUSES` mirrors the first automation's condition for the Institutions Link control, and lists four statuses: the Designer Track was added to the automation in the base but not to the constant. That is fixed on its own, outside this module (open item 4), and it is also the clearest argument for 7.3.

### 2.5 What the Airtable API allows

- **Creating a field** (`POST /v0/meta/bases/{base}/tables/{table}/fields`) needs the `schema.bases:write` scope **and a token whose owner holds the base creator role** on the base.
- **Updating a field** changes its name, its description and its "type-specific options"; the documentation shows a formula and says nothing about adding a choice to a single select. Unverified: open item 1.
- **No endpoint deletes a field or removes a select choice.** What the site creates stays until somebody removes it by hand in Airtable.
- **No scope a token can hold reads or edits automations.**
- `typecast` on a record write creates a missing select choice, but it is not a route for this module: the plugin never sends `typecast`, by rule (the `WPCPM_Airtable::create_records()` docblock: one typo would add an option rather than fail), and the site never writes `Status`, which is for people to set.

### 2.6 What Learn says

Every track course resolves from its link. `GET https://learn.wordpress.org/wp-json/wp/v2/courses?slug=<slug>` returns the course's post ID and title (the 150-hour course is 297853, the 50-hour 322343, the Developer Track 402893, the Designer Track 403425), and the public, unauthenticated `sensei-internal/v1/course-structure/<id>` returns its modules and lessons with their IDs. **All four courses have exactly three modules, Onboarding, Project and Wrap-up, which are the form's own `groups()`**, with `hours` beside them for the hours question.

Only the Designer Track's form is organized by lesson. Of its 17 headings (`lead` and `subgroup` values), 11 match a lesson title exactly once case and apostrophes are folded. The other three forms match 1 of 5, 0 of 1 and 1 of 8, because their headings are the program's own ("Enter your final grade, 0 to 100", "Your reflection posts").

## 3. The architecture, in ten decisions

**1. A Tool, shown as a Module.** `WPCPM_Track_Builder extends WPCPM_Tool` and is added to `WPCPM_Tools::all()`. The admin menu already lists the Tools under a submenu it calls "Modules", because that is what they are to somebody running the program, so the screen is **WPCredits Program → Modules → Track Builder**: the product owner's own word. It is gated on `wpcpm_manage_program`.

**2. Two stores: one people edit, one the site runs on.** Definitions are `wpcpm_track` posts: `public`, `show_ui` and `show_in_rest` false, and a capability type nobody is granted, so no generic post screen can ever reach one (the `WPCPM_Institution_Request` pattern); `supports` title and revisions. The definition is the post meta `_wpcpm_track_definition`, registered with `revisions_enabled` (WordPress 6.4; the plugin requires 6.5), so every saved change is a revision. Creating a track stores its definition through the same save, so the history begins with the track as it was created. **The live site never reads a post.** Publishing compiles every live track into `wpcpm_tracks`, an autoloaded option of a few hundred bytes a track (status, key, label, course, hours, hue, source), and one `wpcpm_track_fields_<key>` per track, not autoloaded, holding its form (the Designer Track's is 8 KB). Two reasons. `WPCPM_Program::labels()` runs for every row of every roster, which rules out a query. And editing a published track must not change the form students see until somebody publishes the change.

**3. The definition is the spec.** A question is exactly a `fields()` entry, keyed by its column, plus three keys the form never sees: `airtable_type`, `learn_lesson_id` and `why`. Compiling strips those three. The runtime is then the code that exists: `render_body()`, `WPCPM_Field_Value`, `handle_save()`, the screenshot store and `link_labels()`, all unchanged.

**4. The map stays the only map.** The module adds callbacks to the four filters that exist (`wpcpm_program_labels`, `wpcpm_program_courses`, `wpcpm_program_hours_targets`, `wpcpm_report_form_fields`) and to two new ones in `WPCPM_Program`: `wpcpm_program_tracks` inside `track()`, and `wpcpm_program_course_ids` on a new `course_ids()` map with its `course_id()` accessor, in the shape of `courses()` and `course_url()`, which Learn Link needs (section 9). Nothing else in the plugin learns that a module exists.

**5. Built-in or definition, per track, as a switch.** This is the migration gate. The four migrated tracks are definitions marked built-in, and each runs from its PHP until a Program Administrator flips it, which is allowed only while the definition is identical to the PHP's output at that moment. Flipping back is allowed while the PHP exists and the definition has not been edited since the flip. **A test alone cannot deliver "confirmed working in the new way"; only the live site running on the definitions can.** The product owner's word then deletes the PHP (T5).

**6. The hard-coded places ask the map.** T1 derives `WPCPM_Administrators_Cards::TRACKS` and its tile names from `WPCPM_Program`; publishing appends to `student_statuses`; the Institutions guard reads an accessor (7.3).

**7. Publishing is a job with a preflight and a fixed order** (section 7), and it is the only writer of Airtable's schema and of the runtime stores.

**8. What no token can do is a checklist a person confirms, and the site checks the symptom.** The two automation changes (2.4) are listed on the publish screen, ticked by whoever made them, logged with who and when, and checked afterwards by counting rows (7.4).

**9. Nothing is deleted.** No column, no choice, no status from `student_statuses`, and no track that was ever published: it is unpublished and kept, because it is the record of what was created in the base. A track that was never published is the one exception, and only because that reason does not reach it (decision 25). Unpublishing is refused while any synced student holds the status.

**10. Badge color from a fixed palette.** A track's chip hue is one of a fixed set of named hues in code, never a color typed on a screen, and defaults to the family of the color Airtable gives its `Status` choice: the Developer Track's teal was chosen for exactly that reason, so a mentor sees the color they see in the base. Slate and amber stay reserved for Paused and Pending graduation. The module prints one `.wpcpm-badge--<key>` rule per authored track through `wp_add_inline_style()` on the plugin's dashboard stylesheet, in the shape that sheet uses (the hue at 0.12 for the background and 0.35 for the border). No theme release is needed: the theme's `.wpcpm-badge` sets only the shape and leaves the Developer and Designer Track chips to the plugin's tint, which is the rule an authored chip gets, and `bin/check-selectors.php` reads the theme's selectors against the source rather than the other way round, so a runtime key cannot fail it. The four built-in tracks keep their hand-written rules.

**The three classes publishing is split across.** `WPCPM_Track_Publish` owns the preflight, the ordered run with its lock and its resume, and verify. `WPCPM_Track_Columns` owns one thing: a question becomes an Airtable field definition, and a schema answer becomes a verdict about a column that already exists - no HTTP, so its suite needs none. `WPCPM_Airtable` gains `create_field()`, the only call that reads the schema token; everything else keeps using the everyday token, so the syncs that run every three hours never hold the right to change the base's structure.

## 4. The definition

### 4.1 The track

| Property | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| `status` | The Airtable `Status` value: trimmed, one line, at most 100 characters, unique among tracks. Never one of the statuses the program already reads with another meaning, case folded: anything in "Past students" (Graduate and the rest), and the two states on no track, Paused and Pending graduation. A status a manager has already added to "Currently mentoring" for the new track is not refused. When the value already exists as a choice in Airtable, the preflight says so and how many rows hold it. **Locked after the first publish**: every map, both syncs and `student_statuses` key on it. |
| `key` | `a-z`, `0-9` and hyphens, 2 to 20 characters, unique. Never `150h`, `50h`, `dev`, `design`, `sensei`, `paused` or `pending`, which `badge()` already emits. Locked after the first publish. |
| `label` | What every screen calls the track. |
| `course_url` | Optional. A `learn.wordpress.org/course/<slug>/` address, resolved on save to `learn_course_id` and the course title. A course that does not resolve warns; it does not block. |
| `hours_target` | Optional, a whole number of hours. Empty means no target (decision 1.9). |
| `hue` | One of the palette's names (3.10). |
| `schema_version` | 1. |

### 4.2 A question

The column name is the key, verbatim and never trimmed: `key()` hashes it, and an Airtable name can end in a space. One column, one question per track, because the same column in two boxes is the bug the contribution teams had. **Never a column the syncs own:** `Name`, `Email`, `Status`, `Mentor`, `Educational institution`, the two internship dates and the three legacy personal-link columns (the `report_*` entries of `WPCPM_Mentors_Sync::fields()` that are not questions). `handle_save()` writes the columns the form names, so a question bound to `Status` would let a student move themselves to another track; found while planning T1 (10 September 2026). The preflight (7.1) also refuses, from the schema, a computed column (formula, lookup, rollup, count) and any link column but `Main Contribution Team`.

| Property | Used by | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | all | One of the ten controls. |
| `label` | all | What the student reads, never copied from the column name. |
| `group` | all | `hours`, `onboarding`, `project` or `wrapup`. |
| `help` | any | A hint under the control, which names it for a screen reader. |
| `lead` | any | A heading before this question: a Learn lesson's name, or the program's own. |
| `subgroup` | any | The same heading treatment, for a run. |
| `note` | any | A sentence after the run ("complete one of the following"). |
| `row` | any | Questions with the same row slug sit side by side. |
| `stack` | inside a row | Shares one column of the pair, in order. |
| `required` | any | The Required mark. Never a browser `required`: a student saves this form a dozen times a term. |
| `min`, `max`, `step` | number | Required for a number. |
| `maxlength` | text | Optional. Refused on a textarea: open item 7, settled 12 September 2026. |
| `mono` | textarea | Monospace and no spellcheck, for code. |
| `options` | select | The choices, which must match the Airtable column's. |
| `hide_from_institution` | any | Kept off everything an institution reads (section 10). Always on for `email`. |
| `airtable_type` | all | The column's Airtable type, recorded from the schema or chosen for a new column. Not part of the form. |
| `learn_lesson_id` | any | The Learn lesson this question reports on. Not part of the form. |
| `why` | any | A developer's note that no student sees: why a column name looks like a slip. Not part of the form. |

A new column's Airtable type follows its control: text is `singleLineText`, textarea `multilineText`, richtext `richText`, url `url`, email `email`, number `number` with the precision its step implies, checkbox `checkbox` (the check icon in `greenBright`, as the base's existing one), select `singleSelect` with the options as its choices, and image `multipleAttachments`. **`team` never gets a new column.** The control is written for `Main Contribution Team`, the one column all four tracks share: its choices are the rows of `Contribution areas`, and the base's link columns each carry a reverse field in the table they point at, so a second link column would reach into a second table.

### 4.3 Storage

`update_post_meta()` unslashes what it is given, so the JSON is stored as `wp_slash( wp_json_encode( $definition, JSON_UNESCAPED_UNICODE | JSON_UNESCAPED_SLASHES ) )`. A label holding a backslash, a quote or U+2019 must come back byte for byte, through a revision as well, and a suite says so.

## 5. Where a track starts

**Blank.** A status, a key and a label, and an empty form.

**A duplicate** (decision 1.7). Every question copies, `why` included. Identity does not: `status`, `key`, `label` and the course start empty, the hue starts as the first one no live track uses, and the copy is a draft that records `duplicated_from`. Every question shares its column. On the copy:

- Rewording a shared question (its label, lead, subgroup, help or note) keeps the column, and warns in place, naming every other track that writes it.
- Changing its control or a select's `options` gives it a column of its own, named `<column> - <key>` and editable until publish, and the question says so where it sits. A different type is a different column. `airtable_type` is never typed: it follows the control for a column being created and is whatever the base says for one that already exists, so moving the control is what moves it.
- A fork is not undone by itself. Changing the control back leaves the forked column, because un-forking silently would discard a name somebody may have chosen on purpose; editing the name back to the shared one brings the sharing notice back. A question no other track shares just changes its control, there being nothing to protect, and a question already published cannot fork at all (decision 23).
- A line at the top of the editor, from the same diff the preflight computes, says either "This track needs no new Airtable columns" or "Publishing will create 3 columns", off the cached schema of decision 24 and saying how old the reading is. When the base cannot be read the line is left off rather than guessed, which is the preflight's own rule.
- Choosing another Learn course matches `learn_lesson_id` again, by exact title, against the new course, and clears and lists the rest.

A duplicate whose questions all share columns needs no column created at all. Its Airtable side is the two `Status` choices and the two automation changes (7.3), so it can be published from T2 on, before any schema token exists.

**From a Learn course link.** The link resolves to the course (2.6), and the editor shows the course's lessons, module by module, beside the form, marking the lessons that already have questions. "Add a question under this lesson" starts a question in the lesson's group, with the lesson's title as its `lead` and its `learn_lesson_id` set. Nothing enters the form without a question, because the form has no heading of its own: `lead` is a property of the first question after it. This is how the Designer Track's form was built by hand, lesson by lesson.

## 6. The screens

All are in wp-admin, all are gated on `wpcpm_manage_program`, and every handler runs the plugin's capability and nonce check before anything else. Forms post and come back, like the Student Report Card's module arrows; JavaScript only makes a move happen in place, and puts it back when the server refuses (`assets/js/modules.js` is the pattern).

**The track list.** One row per track: name, status, key chip, source (built-in or definition), state (draft, published, or "Unpublished changes"), how many students are on it now, its Learn course, who published it last and when, and the Airtable steps still outstanding. New track (blank, or from a Learn course link), Duplicate, Edit, Delete on a track that was never published (decision 25), and for a built-in track the equivalence line and the switch.

**The track editor.** The track's properties, then the questions by group, one row each: label, column name, control, and the row's notice when it has one (shared with the tracks it names, forked, or a column publishing will create). Per row Edit, move up, move down and remove (the column and what students wrote in it stay in Airtable, and the confirmation says so); per group Add a question, which asks for the column name and one of the ten controls and then opens the new question. Above the list, the schema line.

**The question.** One question on a page of its own (decision 22): the column name and the control at the top with the fork and sharing notices beside them, then the properties that apply to that control. Every question has label, group, help, lead, subgroup, note, row, stack, required, `hide_from_institution` and `why`; a number also has min, max and step, text also `maxlength`, textarea also `mono`, and select its options. `learn_lesson_id` is carried through and not drawn until T3c makes it editable. Save returns to the list, and a refusal redraws the one question with what was typed.

**Preview** draws the draft's form as a student sees it, with empty answers and no student's record, through the same renderer: `render_body()` reads the student's record, their pictures and their capability, so the group and field loop is split out to take a field set and empty values. A built-in track that still runs from its PHP is read-only here: it can be duplicated but not edited, or its equivalence would mean nothing.

**History.** The revisions as a question-level diff (added, removed, moved, and which properties changed), and the publish log.

**Publish.** The preflight, the checklist, and the track's name typed to confirm whenever anything will be created in Airtable.

## 7. Publishing

### 7.1 Preflight

Read-only, with the everyday token (`schema.bases:read`):

- Every question's column exists with the recorded type, or will be created, with its Airtable type.
- The table's field count after publishing, against 500: refused over 500, since the API would refuse part-way through and leave half a track, and a warning past 450.
- The `Status` choice on both tables: present, missing, or nearly present (differing by case, spacing or apostrophe, which the syncs would never match).
- `status` and `key` unique; the Learn course reachable (a warning only).
- For a built-in track: equivalence with its PHP.

### 7.2 The order

One run at a time, behind a lock claimed with `add_option()` and a constant value, because T2a's final review found that a claim whose value changes is not atomic. Every step that lands is recorded on the post, and a failed step stops with Airtable's own message, so pressing Publish again resumes at the first step not recorded:

1. Create the columns, one at a time. A refusal because the name is taken is read again: a column of that name with the right type means somebody made it by hand, and it counts as landed.
2. Compile the runtime stores, and append the status to `student_statuses` through `WPCPM_Settings`, which never removes one.
3. The `Status` choice on `Students Reports` and on `Students` is checklist item 3: no token can add a choice to an existing single select (open item 1, settled 12 September 2026).
4. Mark the post published and write the log: who, when, the columns created and the choices added.

The choices come last because they are what lets somebody put a student on the track in the base, and by then everything that student needs already exists.

**The schema token is a second, optional setting**, masked and never sent back to the browser like the Airtable token, and used by steps 1 and 3 and nothing else. The everyday token stays at records plus schema read, so the syncs, which run every three hours, never hold the right to change the base's structure. Without a schema token, step 1 becomes a checklist of the exact columns (name, type, options) for somebody to create, and Publish waits until the preflight finds them. A 403 names both requirements: the `schema.bases:write` scope, and a token owner who holds the base creator role.

### 7.3 The checklist

What the site cannot do is listed with the exact values to use, and each item is ticked by whoever did it and logged:

1. Add the status to the condition of `Add students to Students Reports and Feedback`. Without it, no student on the track gets a report row.
2. Create the track's welcome email automation, as each of the four tracks has one.
3. The two `Status` choices, which no token can add.

Ticking item 1 adds the status to `WPCPM_Institutions::automation_statuses()`, which is the pinned constant plus every track whose item 1 is ticked. That is the list the Link control's guard reads, and it is the list that went stale for the Designer Track.

An unticked item never blocks publishing, because the site cannot see automations either way, but the track list counts it until it is ticked.

### 7.4 Verify against Airtable

Any time, read-only: every column the definition names still exists with its type (a column renamed in the base otherwise surfaces as a silently empty answer), both `Status` choices exist exactly, and the symptom of a missed item 1 is counted with only the `Status` field requested: "4 students on this track in Students, 0 report rows".

### 7.5 Unpublishing

Refused while any synced student holds the status, with the count. Otherwise the track leaves the runtime stores and the post returns to draft. Airtable is not touched, and the status stays in `student_statuses`: removing it is a manager's decision in Settings, where "Currently mentoring" is edited, because `revoke_departed()` would take the Student role from everybody on the track.

## 8. The migration and the removal gate

- **`builtin_fields( $track )`** holds today's branches, and `fields()` becomes `apply_filters( 'wpcpm_report_form_fields', self::builtin_fields( $track ), $track )`. A pure move: `bin/test-report-form.php` passes unchanged.
- The three alumni specs gain `hide_from_institution`, in the PHP too, so the equivalence covers the flag (section 10).
- **`wp wpcredits seed_tracks`** writes the four definitions from `builtin_fields()` and the `WPCPM_Program` maps, with each column's `airtable_type` from the schema (or from the fixture, offline), the four course IDs, `learn_lesson_id` only where a heading matches a lesson exactly (2.6), and `why` written by hand for the columns whose names look like slips. At least these: the three `Site’s` columns (U+2019), `Duplicate & Explore WP Design Library` and its lower-case `link` and `image`, `Advance WordPress User - final grade` (the label says Advanced), `MAAMP` among the tool choices, the two portfolio relabels, and the community meetings question that moves on the Developer Track. The result is committed as `includes/tracks/seeds/<key>.json`, which is also what a fresh install seeds from when it has no tracks. (T2a makes this two commands, because a site must never write into its own plugin folder: `bin/build-seeds.php` writes the files offline, and `wp wpcredits seed-tracks` creates the four definitions on a site from them, as a site does once on its own.)
- Publishing a seeded track creates nothing, because every column and both choices exist. **An empty preflight is the proof that the definitions match the base.**
- **`bin/test-track-definitions.php`** asserts `builtin_fields( $key ) ===` the compiled seed for all four, and the Track Builder screen shows the same comparison live for each built-in track, beside its switch (3.5).
- **T5, on the product owner's word only:** the three branches, `builtin_fields()` and the four tracks' rows in `labels()`, `courses()`, `hours_targets()`, `track()` and `course_ids()` go (the `STATUS_*` constants stay, because other code names them), the built-in marks are cleared, and the suite compares the compiled stores with the seed files.

## 9. Learn Link

Learn Link's `learn_courses` setting is global ("comma-separated course IDs, the track course first") and must equal the whitelist Learn holds for the client. With a course per track that cannot hold. The proposal, for the Learn Link design and not made here: `learn_courses` keeps only the foundational courses every student takes, a student's track course comes from `WPCPM_Program::course_id()` for their status, and Learn's whitelist is the union of both. `learn_lesson_id` is recorded so that Learn Link can one day show a lesson's progress beside the question that reports on it; nothing in this module renders it.

## 10. Privacy, in one place

- `for_institution()` drops every `email` question and the three `ALUMNI_FIELDS` by name. From T2 it reads `hide_from_institution` as well, and the constant stays until T5, with its suite holding the list to the promise.
- A new question is visible to institutions unless it is marked. That is today's rule for everything but email and the alumni answers, because an institution sends its students to do this work.
- The verify count requests the `Status` field and nothing else; no name or address is read.
- `includes/tracks/seeds/*.json` ships and is public on the mirror. The four forms hold nothing personal, and `bin/test-fixtures.php` already walks `includes/` for refused names.
- Definitions are content, not code: an authored label is shown as written and is not in the translation template. The plugin ships no translations (`languages/` holds only the `.pot`), so the four tracks lose nothing visible when they leave `__()`.

## 11. Tests

Suites in the house shape, standalone PHP with stubs:

- **T1:** `bin/test-track-definition.php` covers every validation rule in 4.1 and 4.2; the storage round trip (a backslash, a quote and U+2019, through a revision); compiling; an authored track through all five maps and `course_id()`; and the badge rule, printed only for authored keys and only from the palette. `bin/test-report-form.php` holds every rule to the four hand-written forms: each rule accepts all 115 of their questions. `bin/test-student-program.php` gains a track added through `wpcpm_program_tracks`, which gets its key and its badge. The Programs running card shows an authored track's tile.
- **T2:** `bin/test-track-definitions.php` (3.5 and section 8); the switch refused when the definition is not equivalent, and the way back refused after an edit; a duplicate copying no identity; a published track refusing to unpublish while a student holds its status; `student_statuses` appended to and never trimmed.
- **T3a:** a new `bin/test-track-questions.php` for the pure class: add at a position, move at both ends, remove, rename, a fork on a control change and on new options, the forked name, the sharing index across every definition and the built-in fields, the published-column lock, and a fork that is not undone when the control goes back. `bin/test-track-columns.php` gains the choices comparison in four shapes: every option present, one absent, several absent, and a select against a column that is not one. `bin/test-track-builder.php` gains capability and nonce first on each new handler, and Delete refused on a track that was ever published.
- **T3b:** the preview drawn from a definition with no student and no record; a blank track; and the revision diff, which reports a question added, one removed, one moved and which of its properties changed.
- **T3c:** the course resolver against a captured response, the lesson match on a course change, and the documentation section.
- **T4:** the pipeline against a fake Airtable client: the order, resuming after a failure at every step, the taken-name re-read, the refusal over 500, both 403 messages, the checklist feeding `automation_statuses()`, and no schema call ever made with the everyday token.

## 12. Phases

| Phase | What ships | In Airtable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **T1**, 1.100.0 | The post type, the definition and its validation, the compiled stores, `wpcpm_program_tracks` and `course_id()`, the module's callbacks, and the Programs running card and `automation_statuses()` asking the map. | Nothing |
| **T2a**, 1.101.0 | `builtin_fields()`, the four seeds and `wp wpcredits seed-tracks`, the equivalence check and the switch, the published copy, a compile that checks what it compiles, and publishing and unpublishing, all without a screen (`docs/plans/2026-09-11-track-builder-t2a.md`). | Nothing |
| **T2b**, 1.103.0 | The Track Builder screen: the track list with every track's state, what the last compile left out and how many students are on it, the track's properties, duplication, the switch both ways and the refresh of a stale built-in draft, and the recompile when the settings are saved. No Airtable writes, so it needs no schema token. | Reads only. |
| **T2c**, 1.104.0 | Publishing from the screen: the read-only preflight, the schema token and the column creation of 7.2 step 1, the checklist and its ticks, verify, unpublishing with the student guard, and the institution gate of decision 10. It also folds in the two findings T2b's whole-branch review parked (decision 19): one pass for the student counts, and the recompile off a method with other callers. `validate()` narrows `maxlength` to text at the same time (open item 7), so the rule and the runtime agree before T3's editor offers the box. | Creates the columns a track's questions name. A person adds the two `Status` choices and changes the automations. |
| **T3a**, 1.105.0 | The question editor: the question list and the per-question screen, add, move, remove and rename, forks and shared-column warnings, the cached schema line, Delete on a track that was never published, and the choices comparison in `judge()`. It also takes two of the findings T2c's whole-branch review parked: unpublish returns to the publish screen rather than the list, and the preflight refuses a trashed track. | Nothing new |
| **T3b** | Preview, a blank track, and History: the revisions as a question-level diff beside the publish log. | Nothing |
| **T3c** | The Learn course entry point (the course resolver, the lessons beside the form, the lesson match on a course change), the Track Builder section of `docs/sections/32-admin-tools.md` followed by `bin/build-docs.php`, and `wp wpcredits seed-tracks` exiting non-zero when a seed failed. | Nothing |
| **T4** | Nothing of its own: the schema token, column creation and the choice question all moved into T2c or were settled there (decision 15). The name is kept so older notes still read true. | - |
| **T5** | The PHP removed, on the product owner's word. T5 keeps a lock for the four switched tracks: once their PHP rows go, `builtin_key()` answers `''` and `validate_key()` refuses their reserved keys, so without the lock every compile would leave them out (the final review of T2a). | Nothing |

Each phase is planned on its own in `docs/plans/`, as the Sponsors phases were, and each bumps the version in every place, gets a changelog entry and a zip, and goes to the mirror.

## 13. Open items

1. **Can `update_field` add a choice to a single select?** **Settled on 12 September 2026: no.** Airtable's update-field endpoint changes a field's name, its description and a formula's expression, and adding a choice to an existing single select is not among them; the Airtable connector's own tooling exposes exactly those three. The only route that creates a missing choice is a record write with `typecast`, which 2.5 forbids and which would need the site to write `Status`, which it never does. The two choices stay checklist item 3. T2b shipped without touching Airtable at all, so the confirming run moves to T2c, where the schema token exists: on the throwaway base of decision 16, never `appIzQKfwTn5dyPVp`, where a test column could not be removed.
2. **Learn Link's `learn_courses`** (section 9): the product owner decides, and the Learn Link design is amended before the October cohort starts.
3. **Who mints the schema token. Settled on 12 September 2026:** the product owner mints it, holding the base creator role, and pastes it into the site's Settings; it is never handled by anybody else and never written into a document, a commit or a message (decision 16).
4. **`AUTOMATION_STATUSES` lacks the Designer Track** (2.4): a one-line fix with its suite, in a release of its own, ahead of T1.
5. **What `compile()` reads (decision 3.2).** Decision 3.2 asks for two things at once: publishing compiles every live track, and editing a published track must not change the form students see until somebody publishes the change. `compile()` builds each published track from its latest saved definition, so the two hold together only once publishing records the definition it published (a `_wpcpm_track_published` meta, or the ID of the revision that was published) and `compile()` reads that record instead. T2 settles which before anything calls `compile()`, since publishing, unpublishing (7.5), the switch (3.5) and ticking checklist item 1 (7.3) all recompile. The same record gives the track list an "Unpublished changes" state. **Settled in T2a:** the post meta `_wpcpm_track_published`, the definition as published, stored the way the definition is; a revision's ID was set aside because a site may cap how many revisions it keeps.
6. **`compile()` checks what it compiles.** Every compile rebuilds every published track, including one whose surroundings changed after it was published (a renamed sync column, a status added to the past statuses), and the report form's save writes every column a compiled form names. So `compile()` runs `validate()` on each definition and leaves out any that fails, and any later track that claims a status or key already compiled (the first by post ID keeps it), and the track list shows what was left out. A built-in track is checked with `locked` set to its own status and key, which no other track gets. This is T2's first task; 1.100.0 ships with nothing that calls `compile()`. **Settled in T2a:** each published copy is checked against the site as its PHP describes it, the compiled tracks suspended, and the copies compiled before it, in post ID order; what is left out is recorded in `wpcpm_tracks_skipped`. A track's own status leaves the context only when the track is locked to it, which closes a hole in T1's `validation_context()`: a new track could take one of the four built-in statuses under a key of its own.
7. **`maxlength` on a textarea (4.2). Settled on 12 September 2026: narrowed to text.** `validate()` refuses `maxlength` on a textarea, and T3's editor offers the box for text controls alone. Nothing in the four tracks changes: `maxlength` appears once across all four seeds, on the `text` control "Your Slack name" at 100. A textarea already carries a limit, the form drawing `maxlength="5000"` and the save capping at the same figure, so honoring a spec value would have lowered one rather than added one, and a browser `maxlength` on a prose box stops typing with no message on exactly the questions students write most in. Airtable does not need it either: a `multilineText` cell holds far more. The alternative would have left T3's editor showing a control that does nothing. If a genuinely short textarea is ever wanted, the value layer's own per-spec cap (`max_text`, not a browser attribute and not part of a track question today) is the route, and it waits for a real case.

## 14. Deliberately not in scope

- Airtable automations: the site cannot see them, and they email students.
- Deleting or renaming anything in Airtable.
- Editing Learn courses: the site links to them.
- Per-track feedback surveys and per-track groups: the surveys follow `is_track()` for every track, and every course has the same three modules.
- Tables other than `Students Reports`.
- Translating authored strings.
